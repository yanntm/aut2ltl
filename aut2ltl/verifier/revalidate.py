"""aut2ltl/verifier/revalidate.py — the boundary-crossing filter for NOT_LTL results.

A `NOT_LTL` verdict is only as good as the language it was certified on. When a
result crosses a language boundary — a decomposer recombining parts, a peeler
lifting a residue — the carried counting family described a *sub*-language, and
non-LTL-ness survives neither union, intersection, nor an inexact quotient. This
module is the enforcement of the lift rule
(`bls/definability/witness/algorithm.md`, Lifting): keep an absorbing `NOT_LTL`
only when its family **replays against the host language itself**; otherwise
degrade it to a non-absorbing decline carrying a `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` diagnosis, so
no verdict is asserted and other translators stay free to answer.

Everything that is not a `NOT_LTL` passes through untouched.
