"""
context_pass.py — Rule 1: context-carrying boolean-skeleton simplification.

Adapts the seenPos/seenNeg/dominant mechanics of the user's Java
`Simplifier.simplifyBoolean` to spot.formula DAGs (see algorithm.md for the
rule statement and soundness note).

Core ideas:
- Walk the And/Or skeleton top-down carrying (pos, neg) frozensets of
  asserted subformulas; any node found in a set rewrites to tt/ff
  (identity-based domination — temporal nodes included).
- At And, sibling atoms are asserted true for each child; at Or, asserted
  false (Shannon). "Atom" = any non-And/Or child.
- Temporal siblings are OPENED into now-knowledge instead of staying
  opaque (the initial-state reading of the expansion laws — Gφ ≡ φ ∧ XGφ
  leveraged without materializing the expansion): at And, Gφ asserts the
  conjuncts of φ now, f R g / f M g assert the conjuncts of g now; at Or
  (Shannon: the sibling is assumed FALSE), Fφ refutes each disjunct of φ
  now, f U g / f W g refute the disjuncts of g now (g@0 alone satisfies
  U/W, so ¬(f U g) ⇒ ¬g@0).
- Context resets to empty at every non-boolean operator (knowledge about
  "now" never crosses X/U/G/F/R/W/M); bodies are still visited so nested
  skeletons simplify everywhere.
- Hash-consing makes set membership identity-based and the empty-context
  bulk memoizable per node: O(DAG) outside the skeleton.

No kr/ dependencies: generic LTL in, generic LTL out.
