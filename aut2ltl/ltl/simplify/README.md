# aut2ltl/ltl/simplify — LTL simplification rules (generic, formula-level)

Standalone LTL simplification over hash-consed `spot.formula` DAGs. This
package is deliberately **independent of the kr/ decomposition**: the rules
apply to any LTL formula. It exists because Spot's `tl_simplifier` — even at
full strength — does none of the rules below (measured: `a & (!a | Fb)` and
`(!a & Xa) | (a & Xa)` survive full simplify untouched; measurement recorded in
git history / `docs/HISTORY.md`).

Lineage: the rules adapt the boolean-context machinery of the user's Java
engine (`Simplifier.simplifyBoolean`, `LogicSimplifier.evalInInitial` — the
latter an LTL/CTL adaptation of the initial-state strategy of Bonneland et
al., "Simplification of CTL Formulae for Efficient Model Checking of Petri
Nets", PetriNets 2018).

## Rules

| rule | module | status | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Context pass | `context_pass.py` | DONE | `a & (!a \| G(!a\|Xa))` → `a & G(!a\|Xa)`; `a \| (a&b)` → `a` |
| 2. Now-evaluation | `now_eval.py` | DONE | `a & G(!a)` → `0`; `a & (!a U b)` → `a & b`; `b & (b R c)` → `b & c` |
| 3. Partial factoring | `factor_pass.py` | DONE | `(a&Xb) \| (a&Xc) \| Xd` → `(a&(Xb\|Xc)) \| Xd`; `(a&b) \| (a&!b)` → `a` |
| 4. Unroll-inverse folding | `fold_pass.py` | DONE | `a \| F(!a&Xa)` → `Fa`; `a & G(!a\|Xa)` → `Ga`; `b \| (a & X(aUb))` → `aUb`; S1/S2 subsumption |

### Rule 2 — now-evaluation (`now_rewrite`, hooked into the context pass)

A boolean conjunct `A` in `A ∧ φ` is knowledge about the evaluation
instant of φ — an "initial state" for that subformula, however deeply
nested (LTL adaptation of the initial-state strategy of Bonneland et al.,
PetriNets 2018). Temporal heads under a non-empty context are unrolled
once at that instant; only **shrinking** rewrites apply (see the table in
`now_eval.py`: G/F verdicts, dead-arm reductions `(¬f known) f U g → g`,
`(f known) f R g → g`, and the four constant verdicts). Entailment is
two-tier: hash-consed identity (works for temporal arms) + BDD
implication for propositional nodes. `X` bodies are never touched — the
context legitimately dies at `X`; each body builds its own contexts from
its own skeleton. Trivial constant folds through unary temporal heads
(`X(0)→0` etc.) are done locally; richer folding is Spot-basics
territory downstream.

### Rule 3 — partial factoring (`factor_simplify`)

Greedy shared-term factoring at Or nodes, the SOUND form of the draft
script's idea — only the disjuncts containing the chosen term are grouped,
the rest stay outside: `(t∧A) ∨ (t∧B) ∨ C → (t∧(A∨B)) ∨ C`. Iterated on
the most frequent conjunct (count ≥ 2), each round strictly drops the
disjunct count; the grouped inner Or is factored recursively. Purely
propositional Or nodes (and factored guard groups) go through the
BDD → Minato-ISOP round-trip, accepted only when not larger.

### Rule 4 — unroll-inverse folding (`fold_simplify`)

The kr/ construction emits temporal obligations in locally-unrolled form;
Spot never folds them back. Eight pair-folds (the expansion laws backwards,
valid for arbitrary subformulas): `c | XFc → Fc`, `c & XGc → Gc`,
`g | (f & X(f U g)) → f U g` (same for W; duals for R/M), and the
first-occurrence/induction forms `c | F(¬c & Xc) → Fc`,
`c & G(¬c | Xc) → Gc` (¬c matched two-tier: hash-consed `Not(c)` identity,
then BDD complement). Plus two sibling-subsumption rules (the Formula-5
line redundancy): `c | X(c R d) | G(c | Xd) → c | X(c R d)` and the dual
`c & X(c U d) & F(c & Xd) → c & X(c U d)` — soundness proofs in the module
docstring; the M/W variants are unsound and excluded (regression-tested).
Every rule shrinks the tree AND removes a distinct temporal subformula
(the Couvreur acc-set driver), so folding is the canonical orientation;
now-evaluation only returns constants/arms, so the passes cannot
ping-pong.

Later additions (same module):
- **U/W/R arm-padding removal**: `(c ∧ Xd) U g → c U g` when c ⇒ d and
  g ⇒ d (the Xd conjunct is implied by the U dynamics — every position
  before g fires is followed by c or g), dual for R. Entailment on the
  propositional fragments only (one-way, sound). Found by the census
  class probe: these paddings were the dominant language-equal variant
  pairs in real outputs.
- **GF/FG sibling cofactoring** (`_gffg_cofactor`, boolean args only): under
  the cofinite invariant `FG ψ`, the tail-only `GF φ` argument matters only
  where ψ holds, so `GF φ ∧ FG ψ → GF(φ|ψ) ∧ FG ψ` (e.g.
  `GF(a&b) ∧ FG b → GF a ∧ FG b`); literal dual at Or
  `FG α ∨ GF β → FG(α|¬β) ∨ GF β`. Care-set aggregates all sibling invariants
  (`∧ ψ_k` / `¬(∨ β_k)`); φ restricted via `prop_cofactor`, accepted only when
  strictly smaller. No temporal node added/removed.
- **W/M expansion fold** (in `_find_fold_or` / `_find_fold_and`, flagged
  there as an independent rule): the weak-until / strong-release laws
  `f W g ≡ Gf ∨ (f U g)` and `f M g ≡ Ff ∧ (f R g)`, accepting the
  construction's ¬g-strengthened modal body — `G(f ∧ ¬g) ∨ (f U g) → f W g`
  (sound since `G(f∧¬g) ∨ (fUg) ≡ Gf ∨ (fUg)`), dual `F(f ∨ ¬g) ∧ (f R g) →
  f M g`. The body must be exactly `f` or `f` plus a single ¬g conjunct (any
  other extra conjunct makes `G(body)` strictly stronger — unsound). Trades
  two temporals (G,U) for one (W), so it composes with the cofactoring rule
  in the same bottom-up walk: e.g. `G(!b & h) | ((!b & h) U b)` →cofactor→
  `G(!b & h) | (h U b)` →W-fold→ `h W b` (the source).
- **Boolean left-arm cofactoring** (`_arm_cofactor`): for a binary
  temporal with BOTH arms purely propositional, the left arm is evaluated
  only on the positions where the right arm has not yet fired, so it can be
  restricted to that care-set: `φ U ψ → φ' U ψ` with φ' agreeing with φ on
  `{ψ false}` (same for W); `φ R ψ → φ' R ψ` with φ' agreeing on `{ψ true}`
  (same for M, via `φ R ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ U ¬ψ)`). e.g. `(a∧¬b) U b → a U b`,
  `(e∧¬h) U (e∧h) → e U (e∧h)`. φ' is the Coudert–Madre restrict of φ to the
  care-set (`now_eval.prop_cofactor`, `buddy.bdd_simplify` + BDD→ISOP),
  accepted only when strictly smaller — no temporal node added/removed, so
  the Couvreur acc-set census is untouched.
- **G/F absorption**: a conjunct implied by a sibling `Gφ` (the unrolled
  reading `Gφ ≡ φ ∧ XGφ` as an entailment oracle) is dropped; dually a
  disjunct implying a sibling `Fφ`. Entailment is a small syntactic
  recursion (X/F/G bodies, U/M right arms, W/R held arms, And all /
  Or any — each clause a one-line implication), memoized per node pair.
- **Context-aware S1/S2** (`ctx_subsume`, hooked into the context pass as
  `bool_hook`): under a context refuting c, `X(cRd) ∨ G(c∨Xd) → X(cRd)`
  and the one-step-SHIFTED form `X(c ∨ X(cRd)) ∨ G(c ∨ X(c ∨ Xd))` (the
  per-level X-ladder wrapping) — without the context these are NOT
  redundant (witness `!a; a; cycle{!a}`); the initial-state knowledge
  discharges exactly the missing case. Duals at And under ctx ⊨ c.
  This is the rule that pushed `F(a&Xa)` under Spot's 32-acc cap.

The combined entry `kr.simplify.simplify(f)` = context pass (+ now hook)
→ folding → factoring → after a pass that changed something, one more
context pass (and one more fold after factoring — factoring can expose
fold partners). Closing rules like `XF!a | XFa → 1` (F-merge) are
deliberately left to Spot's simplifier downstream of this package.

### Rule 1 — context pass (`context_simplify`)

A single top-down walk of the **boolean skeleton** (And/Or nodes), carrying
two context sets of asserted subformulas:

- at an **And**, every child is rewritten knowing its sibling "atoms"
  (anything that is not And/Or — APs, negated APs, temporal nodes alike)
  are TRUE: positive atoms land in `pos`, `Not(x)` atoms put `x` in `neg`;
- at an **Or**, dually, siblings are rewritten knowing the atom disjuncts
  are FALSE (Shannon: `x ∨ φ ≡ x ∨ φ[x:=false]`);
- any node found in `pos`/`neg` rewrites to `true`/`false` — this is
  **identity-based domination** and works for temporal subformulas too
  (`Gφ & (b | Gφ)` → `Gφ`), since membership is hash-consed identity;
- the context is **reset at every non-boolean operator**: knowledge about
  "now" never crosses X/U/G/F/R/W/M. Bodies are still visited (with an
  empty context), so nested boolean skeletons simplify everywhere;
- temporal siblings are **opened** into now-knowledge (initial-state
  reading): at And, `Gφ` asserts conj(φ) now, `f R g`/`f M g` assert
  conj(g); at Or (Shannon), `Fφ` refutes disj(φ), `f U g`/`f W g` refute
  disj(g) (g@0 alone satisfies U/W). Opened facts flow **ONE-WAY** along
  the canonical child order (earlier → later): two siblings can derive
  the same fact, and bidirectional opening builds circular support —
  in `a & b & (a M b)` the opened b erased the sibling b while the M
  consumed it (fuzz witness `!(b R (Gb & (b M Gb)))` collapsed to 0).
  One-way flow is sound by sequential replacement: child i is rewritten
  in the presence of the ORIGINAL siblings before it. The sibling nodes
  themselves stay bidirectional (support cycles impossible — a node
  cannot be its own subterm);
- constants fold through Spot's constructors (`And([x, ff]) ≡ ff` etc.).

Subsumed classics: unit propagation `a & (!a | φ) → a & φ`, both
absorptions `a & (b|a) → a` and `a | (a&b) → a`, contradiction/tautology
detection `x & !x → false`, `x | !x → true` (via sibling context).

Soundness: rewrites under a context are sound **in place** (the rewritten
child is equivalent only under that context; the enclosing node is
equivalent overall). Hence results must be compared at the ROOT, which is
what the validation harness does.

Memoization is per `(node, pos, neg)`; outside the boolean skeleton the
context is empty, so the bulk of a big DAG memoizes on the node alone —
the pass is O(DAG) there, and context keys stay small (sibling atoms only).

## Usage

```python
import spot
from kr.simplify import context_simplify
f = spot.formula("a & (!a | G(!a | Xa))")
print(context_simplify(f))   # a & G(!a | Xa)
```

Wired into the kr/ construction pipeline since 2026-06-12: `_simp_f` calls
`simplify_node` per DAG node (KR_SIMP_OWN, size cap KR_SIMP_OWN_LIMIT);
KR_SIMP_OWN_FOLD=0 / KR_SIMP_OWN_FACTOR=0 disable rules 4 / 3.

## Testing (`tests/kr/simplify/`)

Same ground rules as `tests/kr/`: placed scripts, run from project root,
timeouts. Every test case validates **language equivalence** of input vs
output via Spot (`spot.are_equivalent` / containment both ways) in addition
to any expected-shape check — a rule that fires is only PASS if the
rewrite is an equivalence.
