"""The `daisystar` combinator Translator (see algorithm.md).

`Daisystar(child)` peels the initial state's SCC when it is a **rejecting**
length-1 star hub — a hub with petal self-loops, hub-stems, and one-hop spokes
that may themselves exit `C` — i.e. the *reachability* dual of `daisy2`. Because
the SCC is rejecting (Spot tags it), no run that stays in `C` forever accepts, so

    STAY∞ = false      (sound by construction — no oracle, no flat-G safety form)

and the whole language is the least-fixpoint `LEAVE`: finitely many stay-moves
(a petal `σ`, or a return excursion `E_s ∧ X(G_s U R_s)`), then an exit move to a
child — a hub-stem `g_j ∧ X φ_j` or a **spoke-exit** `E_s ∧ X(G_s U (h_k ∧ X φ_k))`.

    Final = LEAVE = stay U ⋁(exit moves)

This sidesteps daisy2's open `Φ_stay` math entirely (its hard half is identically
`false` here). The `LEAVE` body still carries daisy2's flat stay-region, so the
candidate is adopted **only** if a Spot oracle finds it language-equivalent to the
input — otherwise daisystar declines. Always sound; what we measure is coverage.
