"""Star-hub structure helpers behind the `daisystar` reachability peel.

A **daisystar SCC** is the initial state's SCC `C` presented as a length-1 star,
*in the reachability regime*: a hub `h` (the init state) with **petals**
(self-loops `h → h`) and **hub-stems** (exits `h → dst ∉ C`), while every other
state `s ∈ C` is one hop from `h` — a **spoke** with an entry `h → s`, an optional
self-loop **body** `s → s`, a return `s → h`, and optionally **spoke-stems**
`s → dst ∉ C` (exits taken *from inside* a spoke). No edge from a spoke to a third
in-`C` state (that would be a length-2 detour — full daisychain, not this peel).

This differs from `daisy2`'s `star_partition` in two ways, both because daisystar
is the *rejecting* (reachability) regime where `STAY∞` is `false`:

* spoke-exits are **allowed** (daisy2 rejects an edge leaving `C` from a spoke);
* acceptance **marks are ignored** (no `STAY∞`, so no link-mark bookkeeping).

`star_partition` is the accept/decline test and the partition in one pass:
`None` exactly when `C` is not such a star, else `(petals, spokes, hub_stems)`.
`aut2ltl.ltl.twa.reroot` builds `A↓dst` for a stem child.
