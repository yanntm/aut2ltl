"""
portfolio/build.py — assemble a portfolio Translator from an Options + a cited
technique set.

Two modes, one entry point (`build_portfolio`):

* `techniques is None` — the shipped default: the `best` recipe
  (`builder.RECIPES["best"]`), `Simplify(strength(acceptance(daisy(core))), "hi")`
  with `core = first(partscc, bls)`. The strength/acceptance decomposition over a
  self-loop daisy peel flooring on the kr cascade.

* `techniques` is a set/sequence of NAMES — the research path: cite the methods
  that may participate, everything else is knocked out, NO implicit floor. The
  cited PRODUCERS form a `first_success` ladder in CITED ORDER (cited order =
  priority):

      node = first_success([ <cited producers, in cited order> ])

  So `--use muller` is the general Muller-DNF leaf only; `--use buchi` runs ONLY
  the Büchi leaf and DECLINES on a non-Büchi language (no fallback); `--use
  buchi,muller` is a flat ladder tried in that order.

Producers. Six names are PRODUCERS (Translators that can be a ladder rung): the
five kr acceptance leaves `acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / muller` (`muller` is the
general-case BLS fallback), and the integrated cascade `bls` (= `make_hierarchy_class`,
the full Theorem-2 dispatch chain — the whole bls engine as ONE producer, NOT a
first_success of separate leaves). A citation with no producer is an error —
nothing to produce. `--use bls` is the full kr cascade.

Cost note: the kr acceptance leaves all read the SAME holonomy cascade, so the
cited kr leaves are grouped into a single cascade-level `first_success` lifted
ONCE by `as_translator` (one GAP decomposition), positioned at the first cited kr
leaf.
