portfolio/build.py — assemble a portfolio Translator from an Options + a cited
technique set.

Two modes, one entry point (`build_portfolio`):

* `techniques is None` — the hand-tuned BEST default, identical to what the
  module singletons in `portfolio/__init__.py` have always assembled:

      sl        = Sl(options)
      cascade   = as_translator(make_hierarchy_class(options))
      core      = Decompose(first_success([sl, cascade]))
      sl_driven = SlDriven(delegate=core)
      top       = Decompose(first_success([sl_driven, cascade]))

* `techniques` is a set/sequence of NAMES — the research path: cite the methods
  that may participate, everything else is knocked out, NO implicit floor. The
  cited PRODUCERS form a `first_success` ladder in CITED ORDER (cited order =
  priority); the two WRAPPERS wrap that ladder when present:

      node = first_success([ <cited producers, in cited order> ])
      if 'sl_driven' cited:  node = SlDriven(node)      # inner
      if 'decompose' cited:  node = Decompose(node)     # outer

  So `--use bls` is pure BLS-from-Muller; `--use buchi` runs ONLY the Büchi leaf
  and DECLINES on a non-Büchi language (no fallback); `--use sl,buchi,bls` is a
  flat ladder tried in that order; `--use decompose,acc,bls` wraps the ladder.

Producers vs wrappers. Seven names are PRODUCERS (Translators that can be a
ladder rung): the five kr acceptance leaves `acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / bls`,
the integrated default cascade `str` (= `make_hierarchy_class`, the full
Theorem-2 dispatch chain INCLUDING acc — the kr core as ONE producer, the same
object the default portfolio calls `cascade`, NOT a first_success of separate
leaves), and the heuristic `sl` gate. Two are WRAPPERS (they take a leaf/delegate,
so they wrap the ladder rather than sit in it): `sl_driven` and `decompose`. A
citation with no producer (e.g. `--use decompose` alone) is an error — nothing to
produce. `--use str` is the bare kr cascade; `--use decompose,str` is the kr core
under the AND/OR strength decomposition (the default minus the sl gate).

Cost note: the kr acceptance leaves all read the SAME holonomy cascade, so the
cited kr leaves are grouped into a single cascade-level `first_success` lifted
ONCE by `as_translator` (one GAP decomposition), positioned at the first cited kr
leaf. The `sl` gate keeps its own cited position. The only consequence is that an
`sl` cited strictly BETWEEN two kr leaves is ordered relative to the kr group as a
whole, not interleaved into it — an unusual citation, and the architecture tries
the cheap sl gate before the cascade anyway.
