"""
portfolio/builder.py — named assemblies ("recipes") over the translators.

A growing library of convenience builders. Each function takes an `Options` and
returns a ready `Translator` (`Language → LTLResult`), wiring the engines and the
(de)composition approaches into a useful whole and named for the shape it builds.
This is where the "good assemblies" found during exploration are written down so the
CLI (`--use <name>`) and the survey can run them and compare variants.

The building blocks (each a Translator or a Translator→Translator combinator):

    bls(options)     the bls cascade engine, lifted over the GAP holonomy
                     decomposition with the cached LTL-definability gate in front.
    daisy(child)     recursively peel self-loop daisies, flooring on `child`.
    best(options)    the shipped default: strength ∘ acceptance decomposition over a
                     daisy-peel whose core floor is `bls`.

`RECIPES` maps each public recipe name to its builder, so `build_portfolio` can
resolve `--use best` (and variants) to an assembly.
