"""
portfolio/builder.py — the building BLOCKS the recipes assemble.

A small library of reusable builders: each is a `Translator` (`Language →
LTLResult`) or a `Translator → Translator` combinator, wiring the engines and the
(de)composition approaches into a peel/floor shape named for what it builds. The
*recipes* that compose these blocks into named, `--use`-resolvable assemblies live
one-per-module under `portfolio/recipes/` (which exposes the `RECIPES` registry);
the blocks stay here so several recipes can share them.

The blocks:

    bls(options)          the bls cascade engine, lifted over the GAP holonomy
                          decomposition with the cached LTL-definability gate in front.
    core(options)         the non-decomposed floor: `first(partscc, bls)`.
    daisy(child)          recursively peel self-loop daisies, flooring on `child`.
    daisy_pair(child)     `daisy` with the length-1 star `daisy2` slipped in.
    daisy_pair_inv(child) `daisy_pair` with the invariant strip woven per descent.
