"""
portfolio/sl.py — the `Sl` Translator: the sl engine as a contract Translator.

`Sl` wraps aut2ltl.sl's exact self-loop / semi-linear backward labeling
(`reconstruct_ltl`) as a Translator over a `Language`. It pulls the (possibly
nondeterministic) TGBA the sl engine exploits — `Language.tgba()` — runs sl, and
simplifies on equal footing with the cascade (`_simp_f`).

Self-gating, sound BY CONSTRUCTION (not post-hoc). sl partitions each state's
outgoing edges into self-loops and exits, recurses (memoized) on the exit
targets, and assembles the language from that state by fixed rules — G(⋁self) &
GF(⋁acc) when accepting; [G(⋁self)&GF(⋁acc)] | (⋁self U ⋁exit) with exits;
(⋁self) U (⋁exit) non-accepting; ⋁(cond & X succ) for exits-only — with per-edge
downstream invariants conjoined. This is EXACT precisely on the VERY-WEAK (1-weak)
fragment (automata whose only cycles are self-loops); there the U/G/GF encoding is
the standard provably-correct translation. OFF that fragment sl DECLINES (a state
re-entered on the recursion stack, or a successor inside a genuine multi-state SCC
with no validated fragment): the engine's `UNSUPPORTED` sentinel poisons upward
and surfaces here as a DECLINED `LTLResult`; a wrong formula is never
emitted. So soundness is BY CONSTRUCTION (exact-on-fragment + decline-otherwise),
not post-hoc checking.

The f2 (size-2 overapprox) and t2 (terminal-2-SCC) heuristics are a SEPARATE,
verify-before-use layer inside the sl engine: they PROPOSE an LTL fragment for a
2-state / terminal SCC and VALIDATE it by language equivalence before sl may use
it (a wrong guess is simply not adopted). The opt-in KR_GATE_VERIFY audit below is
CONFIRMATION of all this, not its foundation (it found zero rejections over ~170
randltl formulas).

Config is the `portfolio.sl.*` Options (declared in `portfolio/options.py`, seeded
from the legacy KR_GATE_* env vars), held at construction: `enabled` (default ON;
False declines always — the pure-kr A/B), `max_states` (skip a pathologically large
input), `verify` (opt-in audit: re-check are_equivalent, default OFF — confirmation,
not the foundation). `options=None` ⇒ the env-seeded default (legacy behaviour).
