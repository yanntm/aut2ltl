"""deep_nobls_memo recipe — `deep_nobls` with EVERY element on ONE shared `Memo` store,
a BDD-style operation cache keyed on `(operation, Language)`.

Same assembly as `deep_nobls` (cakedsdet seed, then a bottom-up `deep_roundtrip`
re-presenting every DAG node via the no-bls decomposition), with one change: a single
`store = Memo.new_store()` is threaded through the whole recipe and every operation is
wrapped on it — the seed, each no-bls primitive (`Daisy`/`Daisy2`/`DaisystarDet`/
`Daisystar`/`PartScc`), each decomp stage, the daisy fixpoint, the whole, the arm's
simplifier, and the final simplifier. The store is one compute table keyed on
`(id(child), Language)`: the operand is the interned `Language` (BDD/HOA identity), the
operation is the wrapped instance.

`id`-keying is the safe, constant-time choice, and it is what lets ONE store hold every
operation without collision: a language resolved by one operation never shadows another
(a language-only key would make the first stage to touch a language an undisplaceable
"king", and the simplifier could not be memoized without being shadowed by a raw stage's
entry). Each distinct instance is its own sub-recipe — the two `Invariant` stages, and
the seed's vs the arm's peels, do NOT share (different engines, deliberately).

Sound because every operation is a pure function of its language (faithful-or-⊥): a
cached `op(L)` is exactly what `op` recomputes for `L`, never another op's answer — so
output is identical to `deep_nobls`. The win is operational: each `(operation, language)`
pair is computed ONCE, across the whole pipeline and every `deep_roundtrip` node (the
store is a long-lived `WeakKeyDictionary`, releasing a language's whole bucket when the
language is collected). `Memo` stamps no technique tag, so the credited stack is
unchanged from `deep_nobls`.

Motivation (kinska `counting_buchi_1ap_18`, `tests/probes/gate_count.py`): the soundness
gates fire 1271× on only 78 distinct (input, candidate) pairs — 94% exact recomputes,
one suffix re-validated 240× — because the büchi-tower suffixes are re-peeled on every
descent path. The gates are cheap (~17ms); the redundancy is the surrounding peel work
(and the expensive `hi`/r3 simplifier). The shared op cache collapses it to DAG-size
complexity.
