"""deep_nobls recipe — cakedsdet seed, then a DEEP (bottom-up) round trip via nobls.

Two labelers in the two already-separate slots: `cakedsdet` is the forward seed
(automaton → formula, the full assembly, blobs and all), and `nobls` is the return
labeler woven through a `deep_roundtrip` — re-presenting every node of the seed's DAG
bottom-up. `nobls` refuses the cascade, so a node it can re-derive comes back compact
(often smaller) and one it cannot is declined and kept; with the bottom-up order, a
shrunk child can drop its parent under the translate bound and the buchi tower
collapses from the leaves. Never-regress per node (`best_of([identity, relabel(nobls)])`),
a final `hi` simplifier over the whole.
