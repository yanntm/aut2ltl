"""roundtrip_best — the never-regress round trip, a shared seed, three bricks.

The combo of `notes/roundtrip_status.md` direction 3, built from three bricks each with
one concern:

    best_of([ Memo(C), Roundtrip(Memo(C)) ])

- `Roundtrip` — the pure re-presentation move (no size judgment of its own);
- `best_of`  — the choice (keep whichever result the comparator prefers);
- `Memo`     — the only brick that knows about sharing.

One shared `Memo(child)` feeds both arms, so `child` runs once on the seed
language: `Roundtrip`'s seed step calls the same `Memo` the plain arm calls, a
cache hit, so only the relabel on the *re-presented* language is genuinely paid.

Never-regress: the plain arm is the baseline and the round trip displaces it only
when `best_of`'s comparator says it wins. Which comparator that is belongs to
`best_of` (and the caller), not to this brick — the brick neither knows nor
checks its context. That purity is what keeps the combinator algebra sound by
construction.
