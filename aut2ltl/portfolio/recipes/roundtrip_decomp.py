"""roundtrip_decomp recipe — split the top-level AND, re-present each conjunct.

Delegate to `cakedsdet` (what `RECIPES["default"]` points at — our current best) as
both seed and per-conjunct labeler: seed a formula, locate its top-level `∧`, and
re-present each conjunct's language independently with `cakedsdet` — keeping the
conjunct as-is unless the re-derivation is strictly smaller — rebuild the `∧`, then
run a final `hi` simplification over the whole.
