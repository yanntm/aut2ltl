"""
portfolio/sl_driven.py — the `SlDriven` Translator: "kr under sl" (the blaster).

The mirror of the decompose gate (which is "sl under kr"). Here sl is the DRIVER:
`SlDriven(delegate)` runs aut2ltl.sl's exact self-loop backward labeling over
`Language.tgba()`, and wherever sl reaches a state it cannot translate (a
multi-state SCC) it hands the whole sub-automaton from that state to its
`delegate` Translator and reattaches the returned label. sl handles the very-weak
envelope exactly and tiny; the delegate handles the multi-cyclic core — on a
SMALLER automaton than the whole (kr's cost tracks state count, so peeling a
prefix is the structural win).

Soundness: the delegated label is L(sub) = exactly the language sl's own label(q)
would represent, so substituting a sound translator's label is interchangeable
with sl's; the surrounding (already validated) sl construction composes it
correctly (X-wrapped at the crossing edge, invariants re-added).

Termination / no ping-pong: this is the ONLY subtlety of putting `SlDriven` in a
chain, and it is now a one-line wiring rule rather than a mechanism — **`delegate`
must be a Translator that does NOT contain `SlDriven`** (a cascade-based one). On
a single strongly-connected multi-state automaton sl peels nothing and delegates
the whole; if that could route back to `SlDriven` it would loop forever. A
cascade-based delegate is a flat floor — the cascade always succeeds and never
re-enters sl — so the kr↔sl recursion shrinks to that floor and stops.
