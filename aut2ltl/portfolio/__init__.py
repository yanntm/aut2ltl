"""
aut2ltl.portfolio — the composition layer (combinators) over the engines.

A `Language` is translated by whichever Translator wins at each node: the sl gate,
an AND/OR strength/acceptance split (`Decompose`), the sl-driven blaster, or the
kr cascade. Every piece is a Translator (`Language -> LTLResult`); the
engines stay PEERS importing only the contract floor (`aut2ltl.contract` /
`aut2ltl.language`).

The default entry `reconstruct_decomposed` is the assembled composition, built by
`build_portfolio(options, techniques=None)` (`portfolio/build.py`):

    cascade   = as_translator(make_hierarchy_class(options))  # the kr cascade Translator
    core      = Decompose(first_success([sl, cascade]))       # SlDriven's non-recursing delegate
    sl_driven = SlDriven(delegate=core)                       # the blaster ("kr under sl")
    reconstruct_decomposed = Decompose(first_success([sl_driven, cascade]))

`reconstruct_decomposed` splits the input, then hands each atom to the blaster
(sl envelope + delegated cores), with the cascade as the always-succeeds floor.
`core` does NOT contain `SlDriven`, so the kr↔sl recursion shrinks to the cascade
and terminates. `build_portfolio(options, techniques={...})` instead assembles a
cited-technique ladder (the research/CLI path) — see `build.py`.
