aut2ltl/contract.py — the contract floor: the portfolio result struct.

kr has become a PORTFOLIO: a given automaton is reconstructed by whichever
method wins at each node of the decompose-and-recombine dispatch — the
buchi2ltl gate, an AND/OR strength/acceptance split, or one of the leaf
acceptance-dispatch forms (acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / the Muller-DNF
cascade `bls`). The bare `spot.formula` return hid which method fired, so the
top-level entry now returns this struct, carrying the formula plus the SET of
methods that contributed.

`.technique` is a set (deduped) accumulated down the dispatch tree:
  * 'and<n>' / 'or<n>'           — a boolean split into n pieces occurred at some
                                   node (n = number of conjuncts / disjuncts);
                                   subsumes the old `split_report` side channel;
  * 'sl' / 't2' / 'f2'           — the buchi2ltl gate produced a node (its own
                                   technique tokens, split on '+');
  * 'acc' / 'weak' / 'buchi' /
    'cobuchi' / 'bls'            — the leaf acceptance-dispatch method
                                   (`bls` = the general Muller-DNF cascade);
  * 'base'                       — a custom (non-default) reconstruct callable
                                   produced a leaf (probes/tests).

MT-safe by construction: the accumulator is a per-call local threaded by
reference through the dispatch, never a module-level/global recorder.

This module is the contract FLOOR both engines depend on: the data signature
`LTLFormulaResult` and the behavioral signatures `Translator` (automaton in) and
`CascadeTranslator` (decomposed cascade in). The key reification is an explicit
`status` (OK / DECLINED) — "not me" is no longer smuggled as the `UNSUPPORTED`
string inside `.formula`. `status` plus the dataclass being the single extension
point (add a `cost`/size field when a pick-smaller combinator needs an ordering)
is what lets the combinators compose soundly.

    / `det_generic_minimal`). The kr endpoint `aut2cas.reconstruct` realizes this;
    the portfolio combinators (Gate / Decompose / SlDriven / Portfolio) are
    themselves Translators over Translators (their migration to a `Language` input
    is the Phase-2 portfolio pass — until then `reconstruct_decomposed` still
    takes a raw automaton).

    Contract invariant (NOT type-checkable, the load-bearing rule): the returned
    LTLFormulaResult is either language-faithful (`status` OK, `.formula` ≡ L(lang))

    decomposed cascade (a `CascadeHolder` wrapping it) instead of a raw automaton.

    Realized as an OO family: each construction is a *member* — a small class
    (singleton instance) with a fixed `name` (its technique identity, e.g.
    'acc' / 'buchi' / 'cobuchi' / 'weak' / 'bls') and a `__call__` that is
    self-gating (it inspects the cascade and either builds its faithful form or
    DECLINES). The member stamps its own `name` into the LTLFormulaResult's technique,
    so composites (`first_success`) need no out-of-band tagging. `decompose_aut`
    is the adapter that lifts a member up to a `Translator` (twa -> Cascade ->
    result).

    The `CascadeHolder` annotation is a bare forward-ref string (like
    `Translator`'s `spot.twa_graph`) so this floor module stays import-free of the

    (kr/cascade/holder.py); members read cascade attributes off it transparently.
