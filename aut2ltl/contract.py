aut2ltl/contract.py — the contract floor: the portfolio result struct.

kr has become a PORTFOLIO: a given automaton is reconstructed by whichever
method wins at each node of the decompose-and-recombine dispatch — the
buchi2ltl gate, an AND/OR strength/acceptance split, or one of the leaf
acceptance-dispatch forms (acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / the Muller-DNF
cascade `bls`). The bare `spot.formula` return hid which method fired, so the
top-level entry now returns this struct, carrying the formula plus the SET of
methods that contributed.

`.technique` is a set (deduped) accumulated down the dispatch tree:
  * 'and<n>' / 'or<n>'           — a boolean split into n pieces occurred at some
                                   node (n = number of conjuncts / disjuncts);
                                   subsumes the old `split_report` side channel;
  * 'sl' / 't2' / 'f2'           — the buchi2ltl gate produced a node (its own
                                   technique tokens, split on '+');
  * 'acc' / 'weak' / 'buchi' /
    'cobuchi' / 'bls'            — the leaf acceptance-dispatch method
                                   (`bls` = the general Muller-DNF cascade);
  * 'base'                       — a custom (non-default) reconstruct callable
                                   produced a leaf (probes/tests).

MT-safe by construction: the accumulator is a per-call local threaded by
reference through the dispatch, never a module-level/global recorder.

CONTRACT (P-ARCH step 1, 2026-06-14). This module is the contract FLOOR both
engines depend on: the data signature `ReconResult` and the behavioral
signature `Translator`. The key reification is an explicit `status` (OK /
DECLINED) — "not me" is no longer smuggled as the `UNSUPPORTED` string inside
`.formula`. `status` plus the dataclass being the single extension point
(add a `cost`/size field when a pick-smaller combinator needs an ordering) is
what lets the portfolio combinators compose soundly.
