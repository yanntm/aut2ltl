"""The `daisy2` combinator Translator (see algorithm.md).

`Daisy2(child)` peels a **length-1 star hub** — the initial state's SCC when it
is a hub `h` with petal self-loops, stem exits, and one-hop spokes (entry `h→s`,
optional self-loop body, return `s→h`) — generalizing `daisy` by one level. It
emits the daisy production lifted from single letters to **moves** (a petal, or a
spoke excursion `E_s ∧ X(G_s U R_s)`):

    Final = STAY∞ ∨ LEAVE
    STAY∞ = G(stay) ∧ ⋀_i GF(comp_i)
    LEAVE = stay U ⋁_j ( g_j ∧ X φ_j )

with `stay` the move-level stay-region (petal guards, spoke entries, spoke
bodies). The closed move-level form is **not yet solved** (algorithm.md Open
points); `daisy2` therefore emits its current best candidate and adopts it
**only** if a Spot oracle finds it language-equivalent to the input — otherwise
it declines. So it is always sound; what we are measuring is how often the
candidate is complete. It is looser than `daisy` (a whole star SCC, not one
self-loop state) and declines when the SCC is not a length-1 star.
