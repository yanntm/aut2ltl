"""The acceptance-conjunct decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`AccDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by the top-level conjuncts of its acceptance
condition. On a **deterministic** automaton every word has a single run, so for a
conjunctive acceptance `acc = ⋀_i c_i` the language is the **intersection** of the
per-conjunct languages — `L(A) = ⋂_i L(A[acc := c_i])` — exact (on a
nondeterministic automaton the inclusion is strict). So it asks the Language for its
deterministic generic-minimal form (the determinism assumption is thus established
by the query, not assumed of the input), labels each per-conjunct part — recursing
on itself, since a part is single-condition and falls to the base case — and
recombines with ∧, delegating an atomic (non-conjunctive) acceptance to the leaf.
