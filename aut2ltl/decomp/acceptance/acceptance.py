"""The acceptance-conjunct decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`AccDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by the top-level conjuncts of its acceptance
condition. On a **deterministic** automaton every word has a single run, so for a
conjunctive acceptance `acc = ⋀_i c_i` the language is the **intersection** of the
per-conjunct languages — `L(A) = ⋂_i L(A[acc := c_i])` — exact (on a
nondeterministic automaton the inclusion is strict). It is the `decompose` shape
(`aut2ltl/decomp/decompose.py`) with the conjunct `split` over the deterministic
generic-minimal form (so the determinism precondition is established by the query,
not assumed) and a root ∧: recurse on each single-condition part, recombine with
`And`, delegate an atomic (non-conjunctive) acceptance to the leaf.
