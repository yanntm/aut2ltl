"""The strength-decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`StrengthDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by automaton **strength**: Spot's
strength decomposition (Renault et al., TACAS'13) cuts an automaton into its
weak / terminal / strong sub-automata, whose **union** is the language —
`L(A) = ⋃_{k ∈ {w,t,s}} L(decompose_scc(A,k))`, exact for *any* automaton (no
determinism needed). So it labels each strength part — recursing on itself, since a
part is single-strength and falls to the base case — and recombines with ∨,
delegating a single-strength language (no split) to the leaf.
