"""The strength-decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`StrengthDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by automaton **strength**: Spot's
strength decomposition (Renault et al., TACAS'13) cuts an automaton into its
weak / terminal / strong sub-automata, whose **union** is the language —
`L(A) = ⋃_{k ∈ {w,t,s}} L(decompose_scc(A,k))`, exact for *any* automaton (no
determinism needed). It is the `decompose` shape (`aut2ltl/decomp/decompose.py`)
with the strength `split` and a root ∨: recurse on each strength part (each is
single-strength and falls to the leaf), recombine with `Or`, delegate a
single-strength language (no split) to the leaf.
