"""The accepting-SCC decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`SccDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by the accepting SCCs of its automaton: the
per-SCC mark restriction A↾C makes `L(A↾C)` the words that lasso in C, and `L(A)`
is the union over accepting SCCs of these. It is the `decompose` shape
(`aut2ltl/decomp/decompose.py`) with the accepting-SCC `split` and a root ∨: recurse
on each part (A↾C has a single accepting SCC and falls to the leaf), recombine with
`Or`, delegate an atomic part (≤1 accepting SCC) to the leaf. The union is
determinism-free and exact.
