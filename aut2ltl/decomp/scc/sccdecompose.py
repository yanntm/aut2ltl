"""The accepting-SCC decomposition composite Translator (see algorithm.md).

`SccDecompose(leaf)` splits a language by the accepting SCCs of its automaton: the
per-SCC mark restriction A↾C makes `L(A↾C)` the words that lasso in C, and `L(A)`
is the union over accepting SCCs of these. So it labels each part — recursing on
itself, since A↾C has a single accepting SCC and falls to the base case — and
recombines with ∨, delegating an atomic part (≤1 accepting SCC) to the leaf. The
union is determinism-free and exact; the recombination declines if any part does.
