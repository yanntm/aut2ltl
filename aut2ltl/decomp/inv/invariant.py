"""The `inv` Translator decorator (see algorithm.md).

`Invariant(child)` factors the global safety invariant `Σ = ⋁(edge guards)` out of
the input Language, delegates the *simplified* Language to `child`, and re-asserts
`G(Σ)` on `child`'s formula. It is defined entirely against the Translator contract:
it asks the Language for its TGBA, calls `child` once, and combines — it assumes
nothing about what `child` is.

The exact factorization `L(A) = L(strip(A,Σ)) ∩ L(G Σ)` makes this sound for one
application: the strip and the re-assertion of `G(Σ)` sit at the same Language
boundary around the same `child` call, so `child` always receives a self-consistent
language no matter what it does with it.
