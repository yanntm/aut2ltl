"""
Core backward LTL reconstruction logic (DAG-native).

`reconstruct_ltl` runs self-loop backward labeling over a TGBA and returns a
`LTLResult` (`aut2ltl.result`): a hash-consed `spot.formula` DAG on success,
or `status=DECLINED` (`.formula` None) when no exact label exists. Every formula
is built as a `spot.formula` — an adopted `scc_labeler` formula
is spliced as a child node WITHOUT flattening (the kr-under-sl payoff: a
high-sharing core costs only its DAG, never its unfolded `str()`).

The shared automaton-side helpers live in `reconstruction_helpers.py`; this
module is just the engine + its recursive `label`.
