"""
bls/operators/support.py — non-recursive support for the reachability operators.

The five reachability formulas (reach / wreach / solid / wsolid / dashed) are mutually
recursive and live one per file; everything they SHARE that is not itself recursive
lives here:
  - the native spot.formula builders, re-exported under their short names;
  - tracing (KR_TRACE) and the runaway guard (KR_REACH_GUARD);
  - the per-build memo decorator for the solid/dashed helpers;
  - the combined-letter enumeration (Enter/Stay/Leave primitives) and letter fusion.

Depends only on `aut2ltl.ltl.builders`; imports none of the operator modules, so it is
the DAG floor beneath the recursive layer.
