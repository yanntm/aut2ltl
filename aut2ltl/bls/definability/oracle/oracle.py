"""
bls/definability/oracle/oracle.py — the entry: the exact LTL-definability decision.

`decide(lang)` runs the pipeline of `algorithm.md` and returns a three-outcome
verdict: **LTL** (the syntactic ω-semigroup is aperiodic — a theorem),
**NOT_LTL** (a counting family, replayed against the input), or
**INCONCLUSIVE** (a resource cap or an internal failure — never a blind spot).

This is the only impure module of the package: it owns every cap and timeout,
sequences the pure workers, maps each failure to its INCONCLUSIVE reason, and
hands the family to the engine-agnostic replay before asserting anything.
