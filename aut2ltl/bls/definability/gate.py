bls/definability/gate.py — the LTL-definability gate, as a Translator decorator.

The kr cascade is *unsound on a non-LTL language*: the holonomy decomposition still
succeeds, but emits a group component the parser reads as a reset, yielding a wrong
formula. So a non-definable Language must be intercepted *before* the cascade builds.
This module is that border — a decorator that wraps any Translator and gates it on
definability:

    safe = definability_gate(unsound_translator)

The gate has THREE outcomes, not two (see README.md; the algebra is one-sided —
`tester/algorithm.md`, Soundness):

  * **aperiodic reading** → delegate to `inner` (a proof of LTL; the cascade builds);
  * **group + certified witness** → the absorbing `NOT_LTL`, carrying the counting
    family — a proof of non-LTL, independent of the algebra. *Certified* means the
    family is complete AND was replayed in-process against this Language's own
    automaton, toggling with the claimed period (`aut2ltl.verifier`);
  * **group + no certified witness** → a **non-absorbing decline** carrying a
    `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` diagnosis: the group may be an encoding artefact
    (`gf_aa_parity`-class), so no verdict is asserted; `inner` is never called (the
    cascade stays fenced), but every other translator — each sound by construction —
    remains free to answer. A wrong absorbing rejection is thereby impossible.

With the witness knob off (`kr.produce_witness=0`) nothing can certify, so a group
reading always takes the decline branch: disabling witnesses disables absorbing
rejections, never soundness.

The suspect-branch work (GAP witness extraction + replay) is computed once per
Language and cached, since the gate wraps several portfolio rungs and an uncertified
decline lets the walk continue to the next gated arm.

LAYERING / dependencies. The gate orchestrates its leaves — none depends on another:

    gate ──► tester   (label_ltl_definable: definable, conclusive)
         ──► witness  (extract_witness: the Witness material)
         ──► replay   (aut2ltl.verifier.verify: in-process membership check)
         ──► floor    (LTLResult, Translator)

It imports neither `Cascade` nor `aut2cas`; it wraps an arbitrary `Translator`, so it
composes around the cascade adapter without a cycle.
