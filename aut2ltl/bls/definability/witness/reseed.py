"""
bls/definability/witness/reseed.py — re-complete a crossed family on a new host.

A counting family certified for a sub-language can fail on the composed host even
when the host is genuinely non-LTL: the composition masks the certificate's toggle
(both parts of an intersection can count while neither family survives whole). The
verdict is then recoverable **without GAP** — GAP's only contribution was the group
element, and its period word `v` survives the crossing as concrete letters.
`reseed_witness(w, host)` re-expresses `v` over the host's own deterministic form
(one consistent concretization per cube letter) and runs the same
linear-then-ω-power completion there. The result is a first-class host certificate —
same concrete closure, same replay obligation — or `None` when nothing completes
within bounds. Fail-safe: any error is `None`, never a verdict.
