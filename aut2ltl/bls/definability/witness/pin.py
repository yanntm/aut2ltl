"""
bls/definability/witness/pin.py — pin the GAP right-action order of the lift.

The witness lift (`witness._induced_transform`) reads a `Factorization` index word
left-to-right through the transition monoid, composing in the image-list convention
(`s -> g[s]`). That is correct only if it agrees with GAP's right-action product
`gens[w0] * gens[w1] * …`; otherwise the lifted period word `v` comes out reversed
(research note §4 gotcha). A period-2 cycle cannot expose the bug — a 2-cycle equals
its inverse — and a single-letter factor word (e.g. `a;a` on the mod-3 counter) is a
palindrome, so its reversal is itself: neither tests the *direction*.

`check_action_order(lang)` pins it on two fronts, against GAP as the independent
oracle (`gap.witness_eval.eval_word`):

1. the **real** witness `factor` — `_induced_transform` must equal GAP's product;
2. a **constructed, direction-sensitive** word (`_induced_transform(w) != …(reversed
   w)`) — for which `_induced_transform` must match GAP forward *and* mismatch GAP
   on the reversal. This is the part palindromes / period-2 cannot exercise: it
   fails loudly if the composition order is flipped.

The module computes the comparison; it asserts nothing — the probe / test reports it.
