"""
bls/definability/witness/witness.py — extract non-LTL witness material.

`extract_witness(lang)` reads the same form as the definability tester
(`det_generic_minimal`, completed), drives the witness GAP script to obtain a
non-trivial group element of the transition monoid (period `p > 1`) lifted to a
concrete letter word `v`, then tries to COMPLETE a counting family on the
automaton: the linear shape first (`linear.complete_linear` — all orbits, all
phase pairs), the ω-power shape when no tail separates (`omega.complete_omega`
— enriched-monoid candidates). The returned `Witness` may still be incomplete:
completion failure after both shapes is the caller's abstention signal, not an
error. See algorithm.md.
