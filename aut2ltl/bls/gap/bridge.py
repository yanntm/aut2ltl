bls/gap/bridge.py — high-level orchestration for SgpDec holonomy decompositions.

This is the pure, module-level API of the GAP bridge. It wires the focused
sub-services into the two entry points the rest of kr calls:

    decompose_gens : generator images        -> Cascade
    decompose_aut  : caller spot automaton   -> Cascade

The heavy/IO-bound work lives in siblings, kept out of this file on purpose:
- bls/gap/export.py : GAP-source generation (generate_gap_script)
- bls/gap/runner.py : process spawn (run_gap_script, check_gap_available)
- bls/gap/parse.py  : structured-output parser (parse_cascade_output -> Cascade)

See also:
- bls/cascade.py : the result data model + config automaton helpers
- bls/generators.py : Spot aut -> generator images (assumes complete deterministic input)

    End-to-end: caller aut → Spot normalization to a deterministic complete
    minimized parity automaton (min even, via postprocess "parity min even",
    "deterministic", "complete") → generators → GAP (SgpDec holonomy) → Cascade.

    IMPORTANT (per current design): Spot transformations (including any state
    additions for determinization/completion/minimization) are expected and
    normal. The resulting deterministic automaton *is* the authoritative input
    D for the rest of the algorithm (Krohn-Rhodes decomp, reachability formulas,
    Fin(C), Muller DNF assembly). The homomorphism h (state_to_config) and
    acceptance lifting are defined with respect to *this* D's states and
    acceptance condition.

    The caller's original (possibly non-det, Buchi-style) aut is *not* used
    for the construction. Callers should keep it aside themselves only if
    they want a final language-equivalence check (spot.are_equivalent) after
    reconstruction. The LTL we produce is for the language of the normalized D
    (which is equivalent to the original by Spot's postprocess guarantees).

    Completion (and determinization if needed) is handled by Spot; any sink
    that appears is just a normal state. The algebraic construction treats
    everything uniformly via configs. No manual dead-trap.

    This is the standardized input contract for the KR path.
