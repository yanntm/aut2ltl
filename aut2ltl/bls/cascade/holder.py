"""
bls/cascade/holder.py — CascadeHolder: a pure Cascade plus its per-build caches.

The CascadeTranslator members and the recursive reachability core need somewhere
to memoize subproblems and count distinct expansions for the duration of ONE
construction. Rather than module-global memos plus a reset band-aid (the old
operators-module globals + `reset_build_state`), that build state lives
here, on a lightweight wrapper created once per construction (in `bls/aut2cas.py`)
and threaded as the CascadeTranslator input. A fresh holder IS a fresh build: no
reset call, and the memo lifetime equals the holder's — so the previous
`id(casc)`-reuse hazard (a recycled id returning another build's cached formulas)
is gone by construction.

The wrapper is transparent: `__getattr__` delegates every Cascade attribute and
method to the wrapped `cascade`, so the construction code keeps reading
`casc.move_config(...)`, `casc.num_levels`, `casc.all_configs()`, etc. unchanged
while the holder owns `reach_memo` / `helper_memo` / `inst_memo` / `uncond_memo` and the
`reach_calls` / `fin_calls` counters as its own fields. The `Cascade` itself is
never touched (it stays a pure data model).
