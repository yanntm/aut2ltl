Extract transformation generators from a Spot automaton for SgpDec.

The holonomy decomposition (and the Boker et al. LTL construction) operate on
*deterministic complete* (semi)automata. This module provides helpers to turn
such a Spot twa_graph into the list-of-images representation expected by SgpDec.

The main entry point `decompose_aut` (in gap.bridge) now normalizes the input
to a deterministic *complete* minimized parity automaton using Spot before extraction.
Spot's completion is used; it does not always add a sink. Any sink state that
appears is just a normal state of the automaton.

We assume the input aut to `extract_generators` is already deterministic and
complete (as ensured by the higher-level API: the normalized det aut *is* our D).
If it is not complete, extraction will now raise (no more automatic dead-trap injection).

Letters are concrete valuations of the atomic propositions (2^|AP| possible
letters).  For |AP| > ~5 we refuse or truncate (the semigroup becomes huge
anyway and the eventual LTL formulas are already intractable).
