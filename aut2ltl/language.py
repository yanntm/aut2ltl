"""
aut2ltl/language.py — Language: the input to a Translator.

A `Language` denotes one ω-language and hands out the automaton REPRESENTATION a
translator prefers, derived lazily and cached. All representations are
language-equivalent by construction; the object is a handle over representations,
not an abstract word-set (no set algebra — ask for a shape, get an automaton).

Two constructors are the only entry points: `Language.of(aut)` from an arbitrary
HOA automaton, and `Language.of_ltl(f)` from an LTL formula (the one place a
formula enters — it is translated to an automaton lazily, after which everything
is automaton-backed). This is the kr rule "an automaton, never a formula" made a
property of the constructor rather than of the Translator signature.

LAYERING: this is a contract-floor module. It knows spot automata and formulas
(shared dependencies, below every engine) but NOT any engine type — in particular
NOT `Cascade` (kr-specific). The cascade is built on the kr side from
`det_parity_sbacc()` (see kr/aut2cas.py); it is never a representation Language
carries, which would invert the floor -> kr layering.
