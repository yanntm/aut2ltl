"""
aut2ltl/language.py — Language: the input to a Translator.

A `Language` denotes one ω-language and hands out the automaton REPRESENTATION a
translator prefers, derived lazily and cached. All representations are
language-equivalent by construction; the object is a handle over representations,
not an abstract word-set (no set algebra — ask for a shape, get an automaton).

Two constructors are the only entry points: `Language.of(aut)` from an arbitrary
HOA automaton, and `Language.of_ltl(f)` from an LTL formula (the one place a
formula enters — it is translated to an automaton lazily, after which everything
is automaton-backed). This is the kr rule "an automaton, never a formula" made a
property of the constructor rather than of the Translator signature.

As a FACTORY the constructors do two more things, transparent to the client:

  * INTERN on the literal input — a bounded LRU keyed by the canonical formula
    string / the automaton's HOA serialization — so separate calls with the same
    input return one shared `Language`, reusing its lazily-built representations
    and its definability verdict. The aim is to cache the heavy, sometimes-erratic
    spot calls (translate / postprocess), not to trust them to be cheap or to run
    twice the same. Bounded so it never hogs memory (`CACHE_SIZE`).
  * CLEAN the source once, lazily, language-preserving (`_clean` / `_base`):
    `postprocess(generic, <CLEAN_LEVEL>, any)` — Generic keeps the acceptance
    FAMILY (no degeneralization / parity), the level (default Medium) purges
    dead/unreachable states and merges redundant acceptance sets — then
    `remove_unused_ap` drops atomic propositions no edge uses (no postprocess level
    reindexes the alphabet, so we do it ourselves). A rerooted sub-language thus
    arrives smallified, which the heuristic leaves (e.g. partscc) rely on.

Both behaviours are knobs declared as `OptionSpec`s (`CLEAN_LEVEL`, `CACHE_SIZE`).

LAYERING: this is a contract-floor module. It knows spot automata and formulas
(shared dependencies, below every engine) but NOT any engine type — in particular
NOT `Cascade` (kr-specific). The cascade is built on the kr side from
`det_parity_sbacc()` (see bls/aut2cas.py); it is never a representation Language
carries, which would invert the floor -> kr layering.
