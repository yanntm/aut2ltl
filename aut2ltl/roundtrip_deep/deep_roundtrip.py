"""The `deep_roundtrip` Rewriter (see algorithm.md).

`deep_roundtrip(R)` re-presents EVERY node of the formula DAG bottom-up: rewrite a
node's children first, rebuild the node from the re-presented children, then re-present
that rebuilt node with the Rewriter `R`. One post-order pass over the hash-consed DAG,
memoized on node identity — so each distinct node is re-presented once (DAG-complexity),
and a child's reduction is visible to its parent in the SAME pass. That is the lever:
shrinking a child can drop its parent under the translate bound, so the parent becomes
re-presentable in turn and a tower collapses from the leaves up.

No finder and no cut node (unlike `roundtrip` / `roundtrip_decomp`): the descent IS the
search. `R` carries its own never-regress floor (e.g. `best_of([identity, relabel(Λ)])`),
so a node is only ever replaced by an equivalent no-larger form, and a declined
re-presentation keeps the rebuilt node — the pass never regresses or declines.
