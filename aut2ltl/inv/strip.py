"""Σ and the care-set strip — the BDD mechanics behind the `inv` decorator.

`sigma(A)` is the disjunction of all of `A`'s edge guards: a Boolean over `AP`
that every transition's guard implies, hence a global safety invariant of `L(A)`
(every letter any accepted word reads satisfies it). `strip(A, Σ)` rewrites each
guard by the Coudert–Madre restrict under care-set `Σ` (`buddy.bdd_simplify`): the
guard is preserved wherever `Σ` holds and free on `¬Σ`, the letters no edge admits.
See README.md.
