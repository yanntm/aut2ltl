"""
aut2ltl/combinators.py — composite translators built over the contract.

A composite is itself a translator: it delegates to a collection of
sub-translators and combines their `LTLFormulaResult`s. Because every sub-result obeys
the contract invariant (language-faithful or DECLINED, never wrong), the
composite is sound by construction. The combinators here are generic over the
input type, so they apply to both `Translator` (automaton in) and
`CascadeTranslator` (cascade in) stages.

`first_success` is the chain-of-responsibility composite: try the stages in
order, take the first language-faithful result, else decline. The kr
acceptance-dispatch chain (acc → weak → buchi → cobuchi → bls) is one such
composition.
