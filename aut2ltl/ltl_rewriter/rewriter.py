aut2ltl/ltl_rewriter/rewriter.py — the contract floor: the `Rewriter` signature.

A Rewriter is a callable `LTLResult -> LTLResult`: it re-presents an already-held
formula, keeping the `LTLResult` algebra (status, techniques, diagnosis) so rewriters
compose through the same monoids as translators. Like translator.py this module is an
interface — it states the signature and the load-bearing invariant and names no
implementor. The trivial `identity` rewriter (the never-regress floor) lives here.

    A Rewriter is a callable `LTLResult -> LTLResult`. The input is an OK result
    carrying a formula (and the provenance accumulated so far); the output is either
    language-faithful (status OK, `.formula` ≡ the input's) or a NOK (DECLINED) —
    NEVER a wrong formula. Decline closes composition (`first_of` / `best_of`);
    `identity` is the floor that never declines.

    Attribution rule (no-op ⇒ no credit). A Rewriter earns attribution only by an
    actual change to the formula. If it does not change the formula — its output is
    hash-cons-identical to the input (`out.formula == res.formula`) — it MUST return
    the input result VERBATIM, contributing no technique tag: neither its own, nor a
    delegate's. A finder that located a node, or a delegate that itself did nothing,
    is not work; only a changed formula is. So a composite Rewriter must short-circuit
    to its input whenever its rebuild reproduces it (`identity` and a no-op `simplify`
    already embody this), and must not pre-credit delegates it may end up discarding.
