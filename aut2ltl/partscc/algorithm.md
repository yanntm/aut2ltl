# The partscc algorithm — partition a terminal SCC

`PartScc` is a **leaf Translator**: given a `Language` whose automaton is a single
strongly-connected, escape-free component, it partitions that component by
entry-letter and emits one `G(…)` formula for "stay in it forever", validated by
language equivalence — or it declines. It is defined entirely against the
Translator contract and is **self-contained**: it asks the input for one
representation, builds a candidate, checks it, and answers. No composer has to
cooperate, and there is no entry-timing concern (see "Why a leaf" below).

## Motivation

These components are **rare but real** — the `sl` experiment logs carry surviving
examples. The payoff when one fires is outsized: the emitted `φ` is a single
`G(…)` of very low complexity, dramatically smaller than what the general cascade
would produce for the same language. And because every candidate is post-validated
by equivalence, the construction is **never unsound** — at worst it declines. Low
frequency, high payoff, zero risk: that is why it earns a place beside the cascade.
It is not great yet, but it is not bad.

## Setting

The only contract surface `partscc` uses:

```
Label       =  Some φ  |  ⊥                 -- φ an LTL formula; ⊥ = decline
Translator  =  Language → Label             -- a Label also carries a technique tag
```

It asks a `Language` for its **TGBA** form `A = tgba(L) = (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F)`, edges
`(src, g, dst, A)` with a Boolean guard `g` (a BDD over `AP`). Nothing else.

## The shape it accepts

`partscc` labels `A` only when `A` is, as a whole, a **terminal accepting
component**:

- **single SCC** — `A` is strongly connected (every state reaches every state);
- **escape-free** — no edge leaves the component (trivially true when the whole
  automaton is the SCC); together with "single SCC" this means every infinite run
  stays forever, so `L(A)` is purely the steady-state ω-language;
- **size ≥ 2** — a 1-state self-loop is core sl's job, not a partition.

Anything else → `⊥` (decline). The precondition is checked, never assumed.

## The labels

For each state `s`, two disjunctions of guards:

```
L(s)  =  ⋁ { g : (·, g, s, ·) ∈ δ }         -- entry-letter label: edges INTO s
O(s)  =  ⋁ { g : (s, g, ·, ·) ∈ δ }         -- next-step label:   edges OUT of s
```

(All edges are internal here, since `A` is the whole component — so the
legacy "internal-only" caveat is automatic, not a special case.)

## The partition condition

The essence: give each state a formula that **uniquely characterizes** it — so the
letter just read identifies the state, and thereby selects that state's next-step
availability `O(s)` unambiguously. The candidate fires only when the chosen labels
`L(s)` do this:

1. every `L(s)` is strictly tighter than `true` (it actually constrains), and
2. they are **pairwise mutually exclusive**: `L(s) ∧ L(t) = false` for `s ≠ t`.

Condition 2 is the crux — pairwise disjointness *is* uniqueness: at most one
state's label holds per letter, so "which state am I in" is recoverable from the
last letter read. That is what eliminates the explicit states — the disjointness
does the input-determinization, no powerset.

`L(s) = ⋁` incoming guards is just the current *constructor* of such a labeling
(the letters that lead into `s`). The algorithm only needs *a* per-state
characteristic formula — sound (implied whenever the run is genuinely in `s`) and
pairwise-disjoint; how it is produced is a free parameter (see open questions).

## The formula

The pairwise-disjoint `L(s)` make the component **deterministic**: a letter `σ`
leads to the unique state with `σ ∈ L(s)`, written `δ(σ)`. So from the init state
`q0` a word `w` is accepted iff every step is a legal move:

```
w[0] ∈ O(q0)            and            ∀ i.  w[i+1] ∈ O( δ(w[i]) )
```

The right conjunct is the **steady-state transition law** — "if the last letter
put us in `s`, the next letter is a legal move out of `s`" — which, since `δ(w[i])`
is the unique `s` with `w[i] ∈ L(s)`, is the implication form:

```
steady  =  G( ⋀_s ( L(s) → X O(s) ) )
```

The left conjunct **anchors position 0** to the init state's own outgoing
availability — there is no incoming letter at the start, so `q0` is fixed by the
input, not selected by a letter:

```
φ  =  O(q0)  ∧  steady
```

The anchor is the whole point of the leaf framing: `q0` is *part of the input
Language* (the entry the labeler rooted at), so pinning the entry phase needs no
context and no composer — it is read straight off the automaton. A bare steady
`G(⋁_s L(s) ∧ X O(s))` drops the `O(q0)` anchor and over-approximates the entry,
which is why the phase-dependent (alternating) family needs this form.

## Acceptance: fairness on top

So far `φ` is a *safety* skeleton — it pins the (unique) run but says nothing about
which runs are *accepting*. Ask the Language for **state-based acceptance** (sbacc),
so each color (acc set) `i` is a **set of states**, and the condition is generalized
Büchi: `⋀_i Inf(color i)` — hit each color's state-set infinitely often.

Two facts the partition already gives us make this expressible:

- the component is **deterministic**, so word-acceptance = the acceptance of its
  *one* run — nothing to quantify over;
- **state visits are observable from the input**: "in state `s` at time `j ≥ 1`"
  ⟺ "the previous letter `w[j-1] ∈ L(s)`", so "visit `s` infinitely often" ⟺
  `GF L(s)` (`GF` is shift-invariant, so the one-step offset is harmless).

Hence "hit color `i` infinitely often" ⟺ `GF( ⋁_{s ∈ color i} L(s) )`, and the full
formula is the safety skeleton with a generalized-Büchi conjunct per color:

```
φ  =  O(q0)  ∧  G( ⋀_s ( L(s) → X O(s) ) )  ∧  ⋀_colors i  GF( ⋁_{s ∈ color i} L(s) )
```

The safety part pins *the* run; the `GF` part pins *its acceptance*; determinism
makes the conjunction the whole language. When the component is all-accepting (no
colors) the conjunction is empty and `φ` collapses to the safety form above. This
is `sl`-core's `STAY∞ = G(σ) ∧ ⋀ GF(σ_i)` lifted from a single self-loop state to a
deterministic multi-state SCC, with `L(s)` as the per-color guard `σ_i`.

This is exact **only when the acceptance is generalized Büchi** after sbacc; a
parity/Rabin component does not fit `⋀ GF(…)` and falls through to the equivalence
gate (decline). Same `L`-partition precondition; same post-validation safety net.

## Soundness — verify before use

The partition pattern is a candidate *generator*, never trusted on faith. The
gate is one language-equivalence check:

```
accept φ   iff   are_equivalent( A, translate(φ) )
```

translating `φ` back with the project's standard settings. On equality, return
`Some φ` (credit `partscc`); otherwise `⊥`. A wrong guess is simply not adopted,
so `partscc` can never answer unsoundly — it only ever *adds* coverage. In the
pure-leaf framing the "isolate the SCC" step the legacy code performs is a no-op:
`A` already **is** the isolated component.

The gate is also the backstop for acceptance shapes the fairness conjunct does not
model (parity/Rabin after sbacc): such a `φ` will not match `A` and is declined,
never adopted wrongly.

## Why a leaf (no composer impact, no entry-timing)

The input language is *exactly* "stay in the component forever", so `φ` is the
whole answer — there is no prefix and no entry edge to time. Whatever led into the
component was already resolved upstream when the Language was rooted here (the
labeler hands an exit target as its own rooted sub-language); the crossing `X` is
the labeler's ordinary exit rule, applied to `partscc`'s opaque result like any
other child label. So `partscc` owns only the steady state, and the legacy
entry-timing surgery (synchronous-vs-delayed attach, the per-target entry
invariant) has nothing to attach to — it disappears with the in-place framing that
created it.

## Cleanups vs. the legacy t2

- mutual-exclusion is a **BDD test** `L(s) ∧ L(t) == ⊥`, not a string round-trip;
- no `sympy`; no initial-state-rewiring vestiges; no in-place fragment injection;
- the validated `φ` is the whole result, returnable through the normal contract
  (whether to `own_simplify` it before returning is an open choice).

## Status

Implemented (`partscc.py` / `labels.py`): the full anchored + fairness construction
above. It fires (each equivalence-checked) on input-deterministic terminal SCCs of
every acceptance shape it can model:

- **safety, memoryless** — `G(p→Xq)` → `G(!p|Xq)`, and rerooted `a U G(p→Xq)`,
  `FG(!p|Xq)`;
- **safety, phase-dependent (alternating)** — `G((!p∧Xp)|(p∧X!p))` →
  `p ∧ G((p|Xp)∧(!p|X!p))`, `G(a↔Xb)` → `b ∧ G((!a|Xb)∧(a|X!b))`; the leading
  conjunct is the `O(q0)` anchor (legacy t2 needed entry-timing surgery in sl for
  these; here it is read off the input's init state);
- **generalized Büchi** — `GF a ∧ G(a→X!a)` → `G(Fa ∧ (!a|X!a))` (one color), and
  `GF a ∧ GF b ∧ G(a→X!a)` (two colors); the `GF(⋁_{s∈color i} L(s))` conjuncts
  carry the acceptance.

It **soundly declines** whatever it cannot express, never returning a
non-equivalent answer: SCCs that are not letter-deterministic — overlapping
`L`-labels — are rejected at the partition test (`G(a→Fb)`, `G(a→XFb)`, `GF(a∧Xb)`:
the "waiting" and "satisfied" states are not separable by the last letter);
acceptance shapes the fairness conjunct does not model fall to the equivalence gate.

## Open questions (settle by test)

- **Input reachability.** Whether clean single-terminal-SCC Languages actually
  reach us rides on the `Language.of` smallification plan above. Until it lands,
  an SCC embedded in a larger automaton simply makes the leaf decline — never
  wrong, only missed; we do not relax the contract to peek at context.
- **Label constructor.** Incoming-OR is one way to get a unique per-state
  characteristic formula. Where it fails to be pairwise-disjoint, a *better
  constructor* might still pin each state uniquely — this, not coarsening states
  into classes, is the generalization direction. A per-state label is enough, as
  long as it characterizes the state (and hence its `X`-availability) uniquely.
