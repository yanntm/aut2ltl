"""aut2ltl.bounded — run a subprocess under a strict, reapable budget.

The single home for the `timeout --signal=INT --kill-after` wrapper: SIGINT at
the budget lets the tool's own handler (aut2ltl/proc.py) reap its GAP process
group, then SIGKILL after a 1s grace. Returns enough to classify the outcome
(completed / timed out / crashed) by exit code and wall time, agnostic to what
was run (front-end build, spot oracle, …).
