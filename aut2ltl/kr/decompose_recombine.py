kr/decompose_recombine.py — root-level decompose-and-recombine front end.

ORTHOGONAL to the rest of kr/: this module only *consumes* the existing
`decompose_aut` + `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` on acceptance-trivial pieces and
recombines their formula DAGs with a root boolean operator. Nothing in the core
imports this; it is a wrapper you call instead of the monolithic path.

Soundness (kr is language-faithful, a ROOT boolean op is a pure position-0
language op — no temporal-placement / acceptance-coupling caveats):

  * AND by acceptance set.  On a DETERMINISTIC automaton every word has one run,
    so for conjunctive acceptance  acc = ⋀ᵢ cᵢ:
        L(A) = ⋂ᵢ L(A | acc:=cᵢ)        (shared run -> exact)
    Split the acceptance condition by top_conjuncts(), run kr on each
    single-condition piece, recombine with ⋀.  Determinism is REQUIRED here
    (on a nondeterministic automaton ⋂L(Aᵢ) ⊋ L(A)).

  * OR by strength.  Spot's strength decomposition splits an automaton into
    weak / terminal / strong sub-automata whose UNION is the language
    (Renault et al., TACAS'13; exact for any automaton):
        L(A) = ⋃ₖ L(decompose_scc(A,k))
    Run kr on each piece, recombine with ⋁.

Dispatch is keyed on the shape of the deterministic acceptance condition:
conjunctive -> AND; else multi-strength -> OR; else the monolithic kr.

The two splits collapse the Muller DNF out of the Fin web up to the root: each
piece has a singleton good set, so its census is small.  See kr/STATUS.md
("decompose-and-recombine") and kr/TODO.md P1.
