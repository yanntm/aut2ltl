reachability.py — re-export hub for the paper K operators.

The core inductive operators (the 5 reachability formulas + fin_c) live in
reachability_operators.py and fin.py. LTL reconstruction from a cascade is now the
CascadeTranslator members (kr/{acc,buchi,cobuchi,weak,bls}.py) composed by
kr/hierarchy_class.py, lifted to the automaton level by kr/aut2cas.py. This module
only re-exports the operators so existing callers (examples, tests) continue to
work.
