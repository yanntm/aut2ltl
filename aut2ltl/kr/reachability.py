reachability.py — High-level LTL reconstruction from cascades using the paper K operators.

The core inductive operators (5 reachability formulas + fin_c) live in
reachability_operators.py.

This module provides the entry `reconstruct_bls` — the construction of
Boker, Lehtinen & Sickert, "On the Translation of Automata to Linear Temporal
Logic" (FoSSaCS 2022) — which delegates to the paper-faithful assembly
(reconstruct_ltl_paper_style): use of reach + fin_c (Lemma 7) + lifted Muller DNF
over good recurrent config sets (from Spot scc_info). No pattern matching,
no inf-often guessing, no special shortcuts for 1L/init-acc/trapping.
