"""
kr/aut2cas.py — lift a CascadeTranslator up to a Translator via the GAP bridge.

A CascadeTranslator works on an already-decomposed `Cascade`; a `Translator`
works on a contract `Language` (the floor input type). `as_translator` is the
adapter that closes the gap: given a Language it builds the Krohn-Rhodes cascade
with `decompose_lang` (pulls `Language.det_parity_sbacc()` -> GAP SgpDec holonomy)
and runs the cascade-translator on it. The result `Result` (formula +
technique) is forwarded unchanged.

Before building, it runs the LTL-definability gate (`kr/ltl_tester`): the cascade
is unsound on a non-aperiodic language, so a non-definable Language is reported as
NOT_LTL (cached on the Language) instead of built — skipping the explosive
holonomy step entirely on the non-LTL case.

The module builds the default endpoint singleton `reconstruct`
(= `as_translator(hierarchy_class)`): the pure-kr Language -> Result
entry, the cascade-level construction lifted to the Language level.
