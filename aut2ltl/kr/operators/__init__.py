aut2ltl.kr.operators — the paper's inductive reachability operators.

The five inductive reachability formulas (`reachability_operators.py`) and `Fin(C)`
(`fin.py`, Lemma 7) that the cascade-translator members are built on. This package
re-exports the public operators, subsuming the old `kr/reachability.py` hub.
