"""
kr/sl_driven.py — sl-driven reconstruction with kr delegation ("kr UNDER sl").

The mirror of the decompose gate (which is "sl under kr"). Here sl is the
DRIVER: `reconstruct_sl_driven(aut)` runs buchi2ltl's exact self-loop backward
labeling, and wherever sl reaches a state it cannot translate (a multi-state
SCC), it delegates the whole sub-automaton from that state to the NORMAL kr
pipeline `reconstruct_decomposed` (decompose + the sl gate + the cascade) and
reattaches the returned label. sl handles the very-weak envelope exactly and
tiny; kr handles the multi-cyclic core — on a SMALLER automaton than the whole
(kr's cost tracks state count, so peeling a prefix is the structural win).

Soundness: the delegated label is L(sub) = exactly the language sl's own
label(q) would represent, so substituting a sound translator's label is
interchangeable with sl's; the surrounding sl construction (already validated)
composes it correctly (X-wrapped at the crossing edge, invariants re-added).

Termination / no ping-pong: the delegated `reconstruct_decomposed` uses the sl
GATE (`try_heuristic_gate`, with NO scc_labeler), which DECLINES the multi-state
core and routes it to the kr cascade. Delegation therefore bottoms out in the
cascade, never back in the sl-driver.

Orthogonal: nothing in kr imports this; the only buchi2ltl change is the
optional `scc_labeler` param (default None = unchanged behavior).
