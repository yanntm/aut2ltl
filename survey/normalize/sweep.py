"""survey.normalize.sweep — the shared folder harness for the in-place corpus
tools (`dedup`, `canon`).

Walk a folder's files recursively in sorted path order, hand each to an `Op`, and
either REPORT what would change (dry run) or APPLY it (`--prune`). Each tool
supplies only its per-file `Op` and which file `suffixes` it handles; the walk, the
dry-run/apply switch and the tally live here, once — so `dedup` and `canon` share
one API.
