# survey/normalize — AP-normalisation + dedup

Canonicalise the atomic propositions of LTL formulas and HOA automata, and dedup
a folder of them. It is **orthogonal to sample collection** — it does not
generate a corpus; the dataset collectors under `tests/samples/` reuse it as a
shared dedup key. Dedup reports by default (dry run); its `--prune` is the
explicit opt-in that removes the duplicates.

Importable as a module path:

    from survey.normalize import normalize_ltl, polarity_normalize_ltl
    normalize_ltl("p & q")            # -> "a & b"
    polarity_normalize_ltl("!p & q")  # -> "p & q"

## Services

- **`names.py`** — rename APs to `a, b, c…` in order of first occurrence, nothing
  else. `normalize_ltl` / `normalize_hoa` / `normalize_text` (content dispatch).
- **`polarity.py`** — complement each AP so its first literal occurrence is positive,
  nothing else (`!a X F a` and `a X F !a` both fold to `a X F !a`).
  `polarity_normalize_ltl` / `polarity_normalize_hoa` / `polarity_normalize_text`.
- **`dedup.py`** — walk a folder, split each file into items (one per HOA, one per
  non-comment line per `.ltl`), keep the first item per **pluggable** key, drop the
  rest. Reports per-file drop counts by default; `--prune` deletes / rewrites.

The two normalisers are independent (one touches names, the other signs), so they
compose freely. `dedup.default_key` is `polarity ∘ names`.

## CLI

    python3 -m survey.normalize.names    '<formula>' | file.hoa | file.ltl  # normalised form
    python3 -m survey.normalize.polarity '<formula>' | file.hoa | file.ltl  # polarity-canon form
    python3 -m survey.normalize.dedup FOLDER           # dry run: per-file drop counts
    python3 -m survey.normalize.dedup --prune FOLDER   # apply: delete / rewrite dups

## Test

    python3 -m survey.normalize.test_polarity   # OK / raises
    python3 -m survey.normalize.test_imports    # OK / raises

Run from the repo root (so `import survey.normalize` resolves).
