"""normalize — small self-contained AP-normalisation + dedup services.

Two normalisers (`names`, `polarity`) and a folder-walking `dedup` engine that
takes either as a pluggable key. Orthogonal to sample collection: it does not
generate the corpus. `dedup` reports by default (dry run); its `--prune` is the
explicit opt-in that removes duplicates.
