"""survey.example — the unit of input the rest of survey consumes.

An Example is one thing to reconstruct: an inline LTL formula, or an HOA
automaton file. `value` is what gets handed to the front end (the formula text,
or the file path); `display` is what the CSV's input column shows; `source`
records provenance (the originating folder file, or "--ltl"/"--hoa").
