# Construction history (aut2ltl)

The dated, narrative record of how the construction reached its current state —
the "DONE / WIRED / LANDED / tried-and-reverted" log. **Not needed to start a
session** (read `aut2ltl/kr/STATUS.md` for current state; this file is the
archive). Moved out of STATUS.md on 2026-06-14 (P-ARCH step 11).

## Folding & simplification passes (2026-06-12)

- **Letter fusion (the "B" iteration — dag_folding.md counter-measure B, default
  ON, `KR_FUSE_LETTERS=0` restores the per-letter literal shape).** At every
  enumeration site (solid⁺/wsolid⁺ last-step/leave/bad-pre, dashed
  enter_t/enter_b/line-3, fin's `_uncond_reach_strict`) the summand reads the
  letter only through its guard, so letters are grouped by the `_dedupe` key minus
  `li` (enter sites key on the arrival too) and each group emits ONE summand whose
  guard is the Minato-minimized OR (`_fuse_or` in ltl_builders: BDD round-trip via
  `spot.formula_to_bdd`/`bdd_to_formula`, process-lifetime bdd_dict, plain-Or
  fallback). One tail per outcome class instead of per letter — the distinct-tail
  driver shrinks at the source. Soundness argument: dag_folding.md "Letter fusion".
  Measured: `XXa`/`XXXa` collapse to the LITERAL formulas (3/4 tree nodes; XXXa was
  SPOT_TIMEOUT); `Xa` output is `Xa`; `G(a->Xb)` tree 3.6M→22.6k and distinct
  temporal 226→85 (under the 32-acc-set cap → equiv=True); `G(p->(qUr))` tree
  84.8M→55k, 559→121; `G(a->Xa)` 5.1×10¹¹→11.3M; `(a U b)|Gc` 2⁶⁰-saturated→528M;
  `X(a&Xa)` 6.3×10¹³→3.1×10¹⁰ (the remaining ladder wall). Survey: 3 cases flipped
  to True (`XXXa`, `G(a->Xb)`, `Ga|Gb`), zero regressions; grounding: zero
  contradictions; audit CLEAN. Post-fusion log: `kr/testing/logs/fusion_measure_dag_*`.

- **Own rewrite pass wired (the "1c" iteration — kr/simplify/ package,
  KR_SIMP_OWN=1 default, size cap KR_SIMP_OWN_LIMIT=2000, KR_SIMP_OWN_FACTOR toggles
  rule 3).** Three rules Spot lacks (validated standalone 44/44 + 1500-formula
  random fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT, oracle self-tested): (1) context pass —
  sibling-context propagation over the boolean skeleton, identity domination incl.
  temporal nodes, Shannon at Or, reset at temporal boundaries; (2) now-evaluation —
  one-step unroll of G/F/U/R/W/M heads under boolean context (initial-state
  knowledge, Bonneland et al. lineage), two-tier entailment (identity + BDD);
  (3) sound partial factoring + Minato guard groups. Hooked per node in `_simp_f`
  after Spot's pass (one bounded Spot re-pass when rules fire); persistent package
  memos make it amortized O(1) per distinct node; ONE shared bdd_dict per process (a
  second dict next to the fusion one corrupted the equiv-child heap). The size cap
  exists because the uncapped pass sent 3 reactivity cases CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT —
  capped, all construction times are healthy. Measured (capped, vs post-fusion):
  `Ga`→`a & G(!a|Xa)`, `Fa`→`a | F(!a&Xa)`, `a&Xa`→literal `a & Xa`; `G(a->Xb)` tree
  22.6k→12.2k; `G(p->(qUr))` 55k→38.7k; `G(a->Xa)` 11.3M→2.0M; `(aUb)|Gc` 528M→7.7M;
  giants barely move under the cap (`X(a&Xa)` 31G→27.9G). Survey 24 True / 0 FALSE;
  audit CLEAN; grounding zero contradictions. KNOWN regression: rewriting creates
  temporal-body VARIANTS that coexist across branches, raising the
  distinct-eventuality census — `F(a&Xb)` went back over the 32-acc cap (its equiv
  child then dies in the abort path's teardown: `free(): invalid pointer` — infra,
  not semantic). Refinement item: eventuality-aware rewriting (TODO 1c).

- **Unroll-inverse fold pass (the "rule 4" iteration — kr/simplify/fold_pass.py,
  KR_SIMP_OWN_FOLD=1 default).** Eight pair-folds (expansion laws backwards,
  arbitrary subformulas): `c|XFc→Fc`, `c&XGc→Gc`, U/W/R/M one-step forms,
  first-occurrence `c|F(¬c&Xc)→Fc`, induction `c&G(¬c|Xc)→Gc`; plus S1/S2 sibling
  subsumption (Formula-5 line redundancy): `c|X(cRd)|G(c|Xd)→c|X(cRd)` and dual
  `c&X(cUd)&F(c&Xd)→c&X(cUd)` (proofs in module docstring; M/W variants UNSOUND,
  regression-tested; the one-step-SHIFTED ladder variants are genuinely not
  redundant — witness `!a; a; cycle{!a}`). Validated: test_fold_pass 26/26, all
  suites CLEAN, fuzz 3×500 ALL EQUIVALENT zero growth, audit CLEAN. Measured (vs
  post-1c): `F(a&Xa)` census 55→33 / tree 4611→901 / DAG 269→156; `F(a&Xb)` 109→87;
  `G(a|Xb)` 94→82; `G(a->Xa)` 193→147, tree 2.0M→1.5M. Survey: **`G(a->Xb)` flipped
  SPOT_TIMEOUT→True (25 True / 0 FALSE)**, `(aUb)|Gc` 7.7M→6.6M, `X(a&Xa)`
  flatten-gate census 23.1G→13.3G (NB measure_formula_dag's unfolded count for that
  case moved 52.6M→127M — fold changes memo keys and thus the construction path; DAG
  and temporal census both improved). Diagnosis tool: `kr/testing/probe_dag_dump.py`
  (let-binding DAG view + temporal census; the F(a&Xa) dumps that drove the rules are
  in `kr/testing/logs/faxa_dag_dump*.txt`).

- **Per-DAG-node memoized simplification (the "A" iteration).** `_simp_f`
  simplifies each hash-consed node ONCE (id-keyed memo + the shared tl_simplifier's
  internal cache); operators build bottom-up so every call sees already-simplified
  children. Policy `KR_SIMP_OPTS`: hybrid (default) = Spot's full rules only on nodes
  with unfolded size ≤ `KR_SIMP_FULL_LIMIT` (2000), basics (constant folding, X(0)→0)
  above — full's syntactic-implication pass is pairwise and sharing-blind and stalled
  >15s per-node on `X(a&Xa)`, basics never stalls. `KR_SIMP_NODE=0` = old identity
  behavior. Paired with the dead-tail early-out in reach_strong (`reach(…,τ≡false) ≡
  false`, the Table-1 base case), folded tails delete their memo-key subtrees.
  Measured: `a&Xa` 752→311 subproblems; `G(a->Xb)` distinct temporal 538→226,
  unfolded tree 85.5M→3.6M; `G(p->(qUr))` distinct temporal 4115→559 (7.4x); `X(a&Xa)`
  max tail 177x smaller (counts −20% only — the residual is genuine b^k wrapping, see
  dag_folding.md). We still never WAIT on Spot: each call is one node with simplified
  children, and the escape hatch drops Spot from the path entirely.

## Census reduction (2026-06-13)

- **Initial-state opening + context-aware subsumption.** Three additions on top of
  rule 4. (i) Context OPENING (context_pass): temporal siblings feed their
  now-component into the context — Gφ asserts conj(φ), R/M assert conj(g); at Or, Fφ
  refutes disj(φ), U/W refute disj(g). Opened facts flow ONE-WAY (earlier→later in
  canonical child order): bidirectional opening built circular support and was caught
  UNSOUND by fuzz (witness `!(b R (Gb & (b M Gb)))` → 0; the opened b erased the
  sibling b while the M consumed it) — one-way is sound by sequential replacement;
  regression cases in test_context_pass. (ii) G/F ABSORPTION (fold_pass): conjuncts
  implied by a sibling Gφ dropped (small recursive entailment: X/F/G bodies, U/M arms,
  And/Or), dual at Or. (iii) **Context-aware S1/S2** (fold_pass.ctx_subsume, hooked as
  bool_hook into the context pass): under ctx ⊨ ¬c the S1 bare-c case is discharged by
  knowledge, so the unshifted AND the one-step-SHIFTED ladder forms fold — the shapes
  that are provably NOT redundant in isolation. **This pushed `F(a&Xa)` under the
  32-acc cap: census 33→26, Spot equiv True end-to-end.** Measured: `F(a&Xa)` DAG
  156→111, tree 901→453; `F(a&Xb)` census 87→74; `G(a|Xb)` 82→79, tree 6.8k→3.1k;
  survey `X(a&Xa)` flatten census 13.3G→1.5G. Gates: suites 19/18/10/38 CLEAN, fuzz
  3×500 ALL EQUIVALENT, audit CLEAN, survey 25 True / 0 FALSE. Known limitation:
  one-way flow + canonical order misses openings whose source sorts after the target
  (alternating direction across the pipeline's repeated context passes would be sound —
  TODO).

- **Census anatomy + arm-padding removal.** Two probes answered "where does the
  residual census live?" conclusively (`probe_census_classes`, `probe_muller_overlap`
  — both committed): (i) the post-rules census is ~all genuinely distinct languages
  (F(a&Xa) 26/26 classes, F(a&Xb) 74→73, G(a->Xa) 144→≤126), so formula-level interning
  has little headroom; (ii) the Muller DNF is NOT the driver — disjuncts share 83% of
  the census via hash-consing (G(p->(qUr)): two disjuncts, 77 census each, overlap 70,
  whole 84); (iii) **the Fin(C)/¬Fin terms ARE the driver**: per disjunct the two Fin
  conjuncts carry census ~50 each (DAG ~285 each) while the reach/invariant part is ~25
  — including a census-1 conjunct that is LITERALLY language-equivalent to the target
  body (`p -> (q U r)` verified): the construction contains the small answer, buried
  under the Muller-acceptance scaffolding. This is the evidence base for P1 (direct
  Σ₁/Π₁/Π₂/Σ₂ acceptance dispatch instead of the Muller DNF). Spin-off rule from the
  class probe (fold_pass, validated 42/42 + fuzz): **U/W/R arm-padding removal** —
  `(c & Xd) U g → c U g` when c ⇒ d and g ⇒ d (the Xd is implied by the U dynamics; dual
  for R; propositional-fragment entailment, sound one-way): G(p->(qUr)) census 98→84. NB
  the formula must be written `q U r` WITH SPACES — `qUr` parses as ONE atomic
  proposition (an earlier "solved at 21 nodes" reading of this case was that artifact).

- **Config-graph reach FALSE-cut: tried, NEGATIVE, reverted.** Hypothesis: prune
  `reach_strong(S,·,·,T,·)` to `false` when the target is graph-unreachable from the
  source in the config automaton — a cheap, exact, Spot-free cut at the source of the
  σ∧Xτ ladder. Two corrections shrank it to nothing. (1) Soundness: the paper's avoid
  is β-guarded and STRICT-BEFORE arrival (`∀j∈[0..i). δ≠B ∨ w⊭β`, Automata2LTL.txt:573),
  so `T==B` does NOT imply false and walling B in the BFS is unsound — only avoid-FREE
  target reachability is sound. (2) The cut must be SUFFIX-projected, not full-config:
  at recursion level k the target is matched on `T[k:]` (the `level==n` base is `(¬β)Uτ`,
  dropping T), so a full-config cut is the k=0 case and is unsound at k>0. A read-only
  probe over the helper memo showed 30% "cuttable" full-config — but ~all of that was the
  unsound over-cut; the sound suffix-projected cut fires ~104×/41584 on `Xa & XXa` and
  changes DAG/tree/temporal census by ZERO, likewise zero on
  `G(a->Xb)`/`G(p->(qUr))`/`F(a&Xb)`/`Ga|Gb` (audit CLEAN, all equiv True throughout).
  Diagnosis, consistent with the census-anatomy finding above: the explosion lives in the
  **Fin(C) acceptance scaffolding, not in reach** — its redundancy is β/τ-obligation-driven,
  invisible to graph reachability. The free-tail collapse the user is after needs a
  Fin(C)-level recognizer (config in an absorbing accepting class ⇒ constant Fin term), not
  a reach cut. All code reverted; finding kept here.

- **Per-conjunct Fin-reachability fold: LANDED (the Fin(C)-level recognizer the bullet
  above asks for — generalizes and replaces the absorbing-M fold).**
  `config_graph.configs_reachable_from(casc, M)` (delegated via `Cascade`, consumed in
  `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style`; default on, `KR_FOLD_FIN_REACH=0` restores the full
  Muller term). For a good Muller set M, keep `Fin(C∉M)` **only for C reachable from M**
  in the config graph; drop it for every C off M's forward cone. Soundness (per term):
  the `¬Fin(C∈M)` conjuncts force Inf⊇M, and the i.o.-set of a path in a finite digraph
  is **strongly connected**, so any C∈Inf is reachable from M within Inf; contrapositive,
  C unreachable from M ⟹ C∉Inf ⟹ `Fin(C)` — implied, droppable. Pure graph property, no
  containment check. **Subsumes the absorbing-M fold** (M absorbing ⟺ reach(M)=M ⟹ all
  `Fin(C∉M)` drop) and fires where absorbing did not (non-bottom M with a side/transient C
  off its cone). Two wins: (i) it prunes more conjuncts AND (ii) the kept-config set is
  decided BEFORE building `fin_c` — the explosive part — so dropped configs cost zero
  construction. **It bites the distinct-temporal census (the 32-acc driver), not just the
  unfolded tree** — unlike absorbing-only. Measured, no-fold→per-conjunct (absorbing-only
  in parens), `logs/survey_sizes_perconj_2026-06-13`: `a U b` tree 87→13 / temporals 4→1 →
  the LITERAL `b | ((a&!b) U (a&!b&Xb))`; **`F(a&Xb)` tree 4251→2739 / temporals 74→64
  (absorbing: 74, no change)**; `(aUb)|Gc` 637→525 / 22→18 (abs 19); `Ga|Gb` 7026→6438 /
  47→46 (abs: no change); `Fa&Gb` 187→159 / 12→11 (abs: no change); `G(a->Xa)` 144→141;
  `X(a&Xa)` 4138→4134. Still over the cap where they were (`F(a&Xb)` 64>32), but the census
  is now moving on reach-driven cases. Audit CLEAN; survey 0 fail / no regressions. Open:
  the cap cases need deeper census reduction (the kept `¬Fin(M)` / reachable-`Fin` part
  still dominates — census-anatomy finding).

## Acceptance dispatch — direct hierarchy-class φ per Theorem 2 / §9.3 (2026-06-13)

- **Büchi class WIRED on the default path. The structural fix the census-anatomy finding
  pointed to.** `kr/acceptance_dispatch.py` `reconstruct_buchi(casc)`: a deterministic
  **Büchi** cascade (`acc=Inf(0)`, `Π₂`) gets the DIRECT form `φ := ⋁_{C∈α} ¬Fin(C)` — NO
  `Fin(C∉G)` web and NO good-set enumeration (the two Muller-DNF explosions). Soundness:
  `¬Fin(C)` ≡ "C∈inf-set"; the inf-set is strongly connected, so Büchi `inf∩α≠∅` ≡
  `⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)` (a transient accepting C ⇒ `¬Fin`≡false, harmless).
  - **Wiring:** a TOP-LEVEL pre-check at the head of `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate
    `KR_DISPATCH_BUCHI`, default ON; `=0` restores pure Muller for A/B). The hook lives
    THERE — not in `reconstruct_bls` — because the GOTO decompose front end
    (`reconstruct_decomposed`) calls `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` directly per piece; the
    single pre-check covers BOTH entries. Single-condition decompose pieces are exactly
    Büchi/coBüchi, so the dispatch fires per piece (e.g. `GFa&GFb&GFc` and(3): each conjunct
    dispatches).
  - **α is COVER-AWARE** (`config_graph.buchi_accepting_configs`, delegated via `Cascade`):
    read off `build_pruned_config_aut` — every reachable config whose lifted (sbacc) marks
    satisfy the same `g.acc()` oracle `accepting_sc_subsets` uses — NOT the lift-section
    `accepting_configs()` (one config per state). The lift section UNDER-approximates on a
    genuine holonomy cover: wiring first flipped `F(a&Xb)` to equiv=FALSE (`L(buchi)⊊L(orig)`,
    α missed the duplicated accepting sink), the cover reader gives the exact α={(1,1),(1,2)}.
  - **Results (size A/B on the decompose path, `logs/sizes_dispatch_{on,off}_2026-06-13`):**
    `G(p->(qUr))` 84→**14** (tree 20291→751, UNDER the cap → survey equiv=True — the
    challenge case); `G(a->Xa)` 141→30 (tree 1.53M→703); `G(a->Xb)` 79→23; `F(a&Xb)` 64→40;
    `Ga|Gb` 46→18; `GFa` 10→3; `GFa&GFb` 20→6; `GFa&GFb&GFc` 30→9; `X(a&Xa)` 4134→2069 (still
    over the flatten gate — reach-driven). Totals over 35 cases: DAG 61029→47498 (−22%),
    distinct temporals 10907→8491 (−22%); excluding the two giants the tractable cases drop
    578→227 (−61%). **Survey (`logs/survey_wire_buchi_2026-06-13`): 0/35 equiv=FALSE, four
    walls flipped True (`G(p->(qUr))`, `F(a&Xb)`, `G(a->Xa)`, `GFa&GFb&GFc`), zero
    regressions; audit CLEAN.**

- **coBüchi class WIRED, the mirror of Büchi.** `reconstruct_cobuchi(casc)`: a deterministic
  **coBüchi** (persistence, `Σ₂`) cascade gets `φ := ⋀_{C∈α} Fin(C)` (α = the "visit
  finitely"/marked configs) — exact, since coBüchi acceptance is `Inf(ρ)∩Marked=∅` ≡
  `⋀ Fin(C)` (a transient marked C ⇒ `Fin`≡true, harmless). Wired as a SECOND pre-check after
  Büchi in `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_COBUCHI`, default ON). α =
  `config_graph.cobuchi_finite_configs` — the cover-aware DUAL of the Büchi reader. **GATE
  SUBTLETY (the crux, found UNDER decomposition):** `decompose_aut`'s parity step turns the
  natural `Fin(0)` into `Inf(0)|Fin(1)`, on which `acc().is_co_buchi()` is False; the gate
  recovers the natural acceptance via `postprocess(.,"deterministic","generic")` and tests
  `is_co_buchi` there. The `postprocess(.,"coBuchi")` variant is UNSOUND — a recurrence
  cascade (`GFa`) passes it. **Results (`logs/sizes_dispatch_cobuchi_2026-06-13`):** `FGa`
  6→3 temporals, `F(a&Gb)` 7→4, `FGa|FGb` **6195→2779** (tree 1.15×10¹⁸→3.23×10¹⁷ — census
  >½ off, still over the flatten gate so UNVERIFIED, the residual is reach-driven), and the
  reactivity `(GFa&FGb)` 10→7 (its `FGb` AND-piece dispatches). Totals over 35 cases DAG
  47498→28207, distinct temporals 8491→5066 (both −40%). Survey
  (`logs/survey_wire_cobuchi_2026-06-13`): 0/35 equiv=FALSE; audit CLEAN.

- **weak/looping (Δ₁/Σ₁/Π₁) WIRED but OFF by default (`KR_DISPATCH_WEAK`, the experimental
  A/B baseline).** `reconstruct_weak(casc)` = `⋁ over accepting SCC G : end_in(G)`, with
  `end_in(G) = (⋁_{C∈H} reach_to(ι,C)) ∧ (⋀_{C'∈G'} ¬reach_to(ι,C'))` — pure `reach_to`
  (`reach_strong(ι,C,⊥,C,⊤)`), NO Fin; subsumes looping-Büchi (safety `⋀¬reach_to(sink)`) and
  looping-coBüchi (guarantee `⋁reach_to(sink)`). Gate `is_weak_cascade` =
  `is_weak_automaton(postprocess(.,"generic"))`. Placed BEFORE Büchi/coBüchi. Correct
  (flag-on survey 0/35 equiv=FALSE) but a SIZE REGRESSION and therefore kept OFF —
  `probe_weak_dispatch` / `probe_looping_dispatch`: the general form is worse on 6/7 cases;
  dedicated looping is mixed (2 wins `Ga|Gb` 18→14, `F(a&Xb)` 40→30; 3 losses `G(a->Xa)` tree
  703→6263, `G(a->Xb)` 23→30, `a U b` 1→3). Root cause: weak languages are already handled
  smaller by Büchi/coBüchi, and the residual is **reach-driven** (the τ-tail), which NO
  acceptance form touches. Kept in (flagged off) as the A/B baseline for `Acc(c)`.

- **Config-indexed `Acc(c)` for the BOUNDED fragment — WIRED, default ON. Cracks the
  `X(a&Xa)` reach wall: UNVERIFIED 5.1×10⁸ → equiv=True, literal output.**
  `reconstruct_acc(casc)` (`KR_DISPATCH_ACC`, default ON, FIRST in the dispatch chain).
  `φ := Acc(ι)` by bounded unroll of the config graph: `Acc(c) = ⊤` if `L(D from state_of(c))`
  is universal, `⊥` if empty (R1, a small Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle on the INPUT automaton D — lazy +
  cached, NOT on the output); else `⋁_σ guard(σ) ∧ X Acc(move_config(c,σ))` (R2 unroll).
  **SELF-GATING:** a config re-entered on the unroll path that is not ⊤/⊥ is recurrent ⇒ Acc
  declines (None ⇒ caller falls back to the Büchi/coBüchi/Muller chain), so it fires only on
  the bottom/bounded class. It bypasses the reach machinery entirely (no reach_to, no Fin, no
  τ-tail), emitting the literal formula. Complexity `O(|reachable configs| × |Σ|)` memoized
  builds plus ≤ n bounded oracle calls on the small `D`. Measured (`probe_acc_dispatch`):
  `X(a&Xa)` BLS 11835/5.1×10⁸/2069 → Acc **4/5/0**, equiv True; the whole X-ladder collapses
  to the literal; every recurrent control declines → BLS. **Survey
  (`logs/survey_wire_acc_2026-06-13`): the ONLY verdict change is `X(a&Xa)` UNVERIFIED→True;
  0/35 FALSE, zero regressions; audit CLEAN.** Scope (`probe_acc_fuzz`, 3×60 randltl): gate
  rate ~24% but fired cases are almost all TRIVIAL; the high-value deep-bounded case is a rare
  tail. Kept ON (cheap, self-declining, only thing that reaches the bounded reach wall).
  Caveat: Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle in the construction path (bounded, small input) — a structural
  sink-reachability test could replace it (TODO).

## Decompose-and-recombine at the root — LANDED + made the GOTO path (2026-06-13)

`kr/decompose_recombine.py` (orthogonal module, core untouched). ROOT-level language
operations recombine kr outputs soundly with no caveats (kr is language-faithful, a root
operator is a pure position-0 language op): `L(A)=⋃L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋁ kr(Aᵢ) ≡ L(A)` and dually
`L(A)=⋂L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋀ kr(Aᵢ) ≡ L(A)`. `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` (AUTOMATON-in) normalizes to
a DETERMINISTIC, STATE-MINIMAL GENERIC automaton, then dispatches:
- `_to_split_form`: `postprocess(aut,"deterministic","generic")` (keeps the conjunctive
  `⋀Inf`/Streett shape) THEN `sat_minimize` (gated `KR_SAT_MIN_STATES`). State minimality is
  load-bearing: kr's census is acutely sensitive to the input state count. `GFa&FGb`:
  `postprocess` alone leaves 2 states whose pieces explode (recombined tree 9.5e15);
  `sat_minimize` recovers the 1-state form (tree 313) — PURELY on the automaton
  (`probe_min_detgeneric`).
- **AND by acceptance set** (`acc().get_acceptance().top_conjuncts()`): for a DETERMINISTIC
  automaton each word has one run, so `acc=⋀cᵢ ⟹ L=⋂L(A|cᵢ)` exactly; one single-condition
  sub-automaton per conjunct (clone via HOA round-trip), recombine with `⋀`.
- **OR by strength** (`decompose_scc` weak/terminal/strong, Renault TACAS'13): union is the
  language; recombine with `⋁`.
- else single condition → existing monolithic kr.
Each piece runs the EXISTING `decompose_aut`+`reconstruct` (Fin web collapses to a singleton
good-set), so the Muller ∨/∧ is hoisted out of the Fin web to the root — no hand-coding the
§9.3 Σ/Π/Δ forms. Decompose-path survey (`logs/survey_decompose_2026-06-13.txt`) vs the
monolithic baseline: **0 of 8 two-level cases fail equiv, zero regressions, four
acceptance-driven walls flip UNVERIFIED→True plus a new 7-level case verifies**:

| case | split | monolithic | decompose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GFa&GFb` | and(2) | UNVERIFIED 9.08×10¹⁶ | **True** (tree 111, 20 temporals) |
| `(aUb)\|Gc` | or(2) | UNVERIFIED 6.97M | **True** (637) |
| `(GFa&FGb)` | and(2) | UNVERIFIED 2⁶⁰ | **True** |
| `GFa->GFb` | and | (n/a) | **True** |
| `G(a->Fb)&G(c->Fd)` | and(2) | (new) | **True** at L=7 |
| `Ga\|Fb` | or(2) | True (tree 499) | **True** (tree 21, 2 temporals) |
| `GFa&GFb&GFc` | and(3) | can't build | SPOT_TIMEOUT (cap); compositional **SOUND** |

Verification at scale: for n≥3 the recombined `⋀` trips Spot's 32-acc cap, so the sound
witness is COMPOSITIONAL — `kr(pieceᵢ) ≡ L(pieceᵢ)` per single-Büchi piece, which by
`L(A)=⋂L(pieceᵢ)` gives `⋀kr(pieceᵢ) ≡ L(A)` without translating the product
(`probe_and_decompose.py`). KNOWN LIMITATIONS (acceptance ABSORPTION blocks both splits):
`GFa&Gb` (recurrence ∧ safety) and `FGa|FGb` (persistence union) — Spot's determinization
folds the second component into a single acceptance set / strength, so the split sees one
piece (`none`). The principled fix (expose the absorbed component) is blocked by that folding
— since carried by the buchi2ltl gate (below).

## buchi2ltl heuristic gate + portfolio (2026-06-14)

- **buchi2ltl heuristic gate — WIRED into the decompose dispatcher, default ON. Cracks the
  last MP wall `FGa|FGb`; the MP survey is now a clean sweep.** `kr/heuristic_gate.py`
  `try_heuristic_gate(aut)` is the SINGLE seam between the two paths (the kr core operators
  import nothing from `buchi2ltl/`; the old "never mix" rule is retired). **Gate goes UNDER
  decomposition (`KR_GATE_UNDER_DECOMP`, default ON):** `decompose_recombine` splits FIRST and
  applies the gate only to the leaves that no longer split — so a decomposable input is always
  cut into pieces, even when the gate could take the whole. Exception: when the ROOT does not
  split, the gate runs on the RAW (pre-determinization) input. This makes the reported
  technique honest: a case `split_report` says `or(2)` now actually decomposes (`tech=or+sl`).
  Size effect is a wash (DAG 494→491, temporal 114→119).
  - **Soundness is a composition of sound steps, NO per-call equiv check:** arbitrary HOA
    →(Spot `postprocess` to TGBA, language-preserving)→ buchi2ltl. buchi2ltl's CORE is `sl`
    (self-loop backward labeling) — an EXACT state-elimination translation on the very-weak
    (1-weak) fragment, DECLINING (`UNSUPPORTED`) elsewhere; its f2/t2 layer is a separate
    verify-before-use guess-and-check. So adopted output is sound by construction. The bounded
    equiv check is an OPT-IN audit (`KR_GATE_VERIFY`, default OFF). **Audited at scale
    (`fuzz_gate_decompose.py`, VERIFY=1, 3 seeds ≈170 randltl / 191 piece-adoptions): 0
    equiv=FALSE, 0 rejections, ~81% adopt rate** (`logs/fuzz_gate_seed{1,2,3}_2026-06-14`).
  - **Why determinize-then-gate is NOT enough (`probe_gate_redet.py`):** buchi2ltl's backward
    labeling exploits the (often nondeterministic) translate-style TGBA, which
    `_to_split_form`'s determinization destroys. `FGa|FGb` goes raw 3-state nondet Büchi
    (buchi2ltl ok tree=13) → det 2-state coBüchi → re-projected 4-state nondet Büchi that
    buchi2ltl DECLINES — a one-way loss. Hence the gate runs on the RAW input exactly when the
    root does not split.
  - **Adopted output is simplified through `_simp_f`** (buchi2ltl does not wire Spot's LTL
    simplifier; `Fa|Gb` raw 5-temporal → 2-temporal). `probe_gate_inspect.py` shows
    before/after.
  - **Results (gate ON vs OFF, `logs/survey_sizes_gate_{on,off}_2026-06-14`):** `FGa|FGb`
    **2779→3** (tree 3.2×10¹⁷→6 — the last wall collapses); `G(a->Xb)` 23→1; `G(a->Xa)` 30→2;
    `Ga|Gb` 18→3; `GFa->GFb` 19→4; `GFa&GFb&GFc` tree 46→8 / 9→4; `(aUb)|Gc` 9→3; `Fa&Gb` 7→2.
    Totals over 35 cases: distinct temporals **2997→114 (−96%)**, DAG 16376→494, tree
    3.2×10¹⁷→1951. **Zero regressions.**
  - **Gates:** r4 audit CLEAN; MP survey `logs/survey_gate_buchi2ltl_2026-06-14` **0/35
    equiv=FALSE, every case True**. Gate `KR_GATE_BUCHI2LTL` (default ON). Side-by-side:
    `testing/run_mp_through_buchi2ltl.py` (30/35 handled standalone, 0 FALSE).

- **Portfolio result struct (`kr.recon_result.ReconResult`).** kr is now a portfolio (gate /
  and-split / or-split / acc / weak / buchi / cobuchi / bls-Muller), so `reconstruct_decomposed`
  returns a `ReconResult` (`.formula` + `.technique`, a deduped SET of method tags) instead of a
  bare formula. buchi2ltl's `reconstruct_ltl` returns the SAME struct. The set is threaded by
  reference down the dispatch (MT-safe). Wired into both surveys' `tech=` column.

- **Contract reification — `status` (P-ARCH step 1).** `ReconResult` gained an explicit
  `status` (OK / DECLINED) with `ReconResult.decline()` / `.declined` / `.ok`; "not me" is no
  longer the `UNSUPPORTED` string smuggled inside `.formula` (engines still use that string
  INTERNALLY in their recursion — translated to DECLINED at the boundary return of
  `reconstruct_ltl`). Consumers branch on `.declined`. The `Translator` Protocol (callable
  `twa -> ReconResult`; invariant: language-faithful OR declines, never wrong) is documented in
  the contract module. Gates: r4 audit CLEAN, MP survey clean sweep
  (`logs/survey_parch_step1_2026-06-14.txt`).

- **kr UNDER sl — full-suffix delegation prototype (`kr/sl_driven.py` + one optional
  `buchi2ltl` hook). The mirror of the decompose gate.** `reconstruct_sl_driven(aut)` runs sl
  as the DRIVER; at any multi-state-SCC state it delegates the whole sub-automaton A_q to the
  normal `reconstruct_decomposed` and reattaches the label. Seam: optional `scc_labeler`
  callback on the DAG-native engine `reconstruct_ltl` (the labeler returns a `spot.formula` DAG,
  spliced as a child node WITHOUT flattening). Termination: delegated kr uses the sl GATE (no
  labeler) → declines the core → cascade; never re-enters the driver. Soundness: the delegated
  label is L(A_q) = exactly the language sl's own label(q) represents (`probe_sl_compose`: 0
  equiv=FALSE). Results: `XX(G(a->Fb))` kr-on-full 5596 DAG / **1.2×10¹⁴ tree** → sl-driven
  **21 nodes**; `c U (G(a->Fb))` kr-on-full TIMEOUT → **28**; `XX(F(a&Xb))` 2957 DAG / 1.1×10⁹
  tree → 183. **Boundary flattening RESOLVED (buchi2ltl is now DAG-native):** `reconstruct_ltl`
  builds a hash-consed `spot.formula` DAG end to end (t2 fragments included); the `scc_labeler`
  returns the kr DAG directly (no `str()`). The DAG engine was cross-oracled against the (now
  deleted) string engine across the MP ladder + randltl with 0 divergences. Not wired into any
  default path (a top-level chooser + scale soundness fuzz are later steps).

## Representation / verification probes (dead ends, kept as record)

- **Object-out API landed (P0 plumbing, 2026-06-12).** With reconstruct returning the DAG and
  harnesses flattening only under `KR_FLATTEN_TREE_LIMIT` (survey default 5M tree nodes), the
  former CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT class became measured verdicts in seconds: `G(a->Xa)` ~2k DAG nodes
  unfolding to **5.1×10¹¹** tree nodes (sharing ~2.5×10⁸); `(a U b)|Gc` saturates the counter at
  2⁶⁰. Audit CLEAN.

- **Native-operator basis: investigated and CLOSED (2026-06-12, `probe_native_ops`).** Spot's
  constructors do NOT rewrite sugar (`U(1,a)` and `¬(a U b)` stay raw nodes), but the per-node
  simplifier normalizes every node to NNF even in basics-only mode; since the operators build
  bottom-up through `_simp_f`, **outputs are already in the native G/F/R/W basis** — census of
  real outputs shows `Not` only over atomic propositions. The surviving U nodes are GENUINE
  strong eventualities (distinct `¬β U τ` base cases): 94 in `G(a->Xb)`, 246 in `G(p->(qUr))` —
  the >32-acc-set driver is the genuine eventuality count, which no operator-basis change can
  reduce. Reduction must come from folding or non-translation verification. Baselines:
  `kr/testing/logs/baseline_*_2026-06-12.txt`.

- **Object-path translation is a dead end (2026-06-12, `probe_object_translate.py`).** Spot
  accepts our formula objects natively (`ltl_to_tgba_fm`, `translate`, `translator` class — no
  string round-trip), but Couvreur allocates one acceptance set per DISTINCT eventuality: our
  400–600 distinct temporal subterms blow the compile-time `mark_t` cap (32 in system Spot
  2.14.5) instantly, and `Ga|Gb` grinds >10s in the tableau before reaching the cap — the
  tableau's state space is sets of subformulas, which hash-consing does not shrink. Verification
  must come from word sampling / compositional grounding, or from folding the eventuality count
  below the cap.

## One-shot probe lifecycle (cleanup 2026-06-12)

A probe built to answer ONE question is committed, its finding recorded, then deleted — git
history keeps it. Removed in that sweep: `probe_object_translate`, `probe_native_ops`,
`probe_2l_rwith`, `probe_sbacc` (sbacc is baked into the pipeline), `test_kr_arch_adopt`,
`test_kr_muller` (settled in `config_graph`), `diag_stability` (per-case subprocess isolation
is now standard). Dead code swept the same day: unused `_F`/`_G` sugar builders (outputs get
native F/G via `_simp_f` NNF), and the never-read legacy 7-tuple `_reach_memo` write in
`reach_strong` (`_reach_memo` itself stays — `fin.py` caches through it).

## sl_driven full-suffix delegation — invariant-strip soundness fix (2026-06-15)

Kinská counting cases 06/07/09/10 reconstructed to unsound under-approximations
(06: L = (a.!a)*.a^w came out as bare `a`). Root cause: `reconstruct_ltl` strips
each state's downstream invariant off the automaton
(`_apply_downstream_invariants`), sound only because the linear walk re-adds it,
timed (X-wrapped), as it ENTERS the owning state. Full-suffix delegation skips
that walk; when the init state is itself in a multi-state SCC, `label(init)`
delegates the whole automaton up front, so a stripped INTERIOR invariant (a
terminal sink's `G a`) is never re-added and the delegate translates a widened
language. Not a loop-back/prefix issue (the sink is terminal) and not fixable by
a single end-AND (the invariant is interior, not global to the suffix, so it has
a temporal moment lost in the opaque fragment). Fix: keep `pristine_aut`
(pre-strip) and root `_sub_automaton_from` on it — numbering is preserved, the
delegate sees the invariant intact. 06/07 -> sound UNVERIFIED_SIZE; 09/10 ->
correctly NOT_LTL (the bogus `a` had masked the aperiodicity gate). Full kinska
sweep FALSE 4 -> 0. Tools kept: tests/sl/trace_sl_driven.py,
tests/sl/init_scc_report.py, tests/kr/diff_hoa.py, tests/kinska_breakdown.py.

Harness, same day: tests/survey.py enforces the per-case budget via
`timeout --signal=INT --kill-after=1` so a runaway GAP is reaped (no orphan), and
reports external wall time as build_s for every outcome. tests/kinska_sweep.sh
sweeps the corpus at a strict 15s/run (prunes its own logs/ from discovery).

## 2026-06-15 — simplify rule 4: boolean left-arm cofactoring (DONE)

New rule in `aut2ltl/ltl/simplify` (fold_pass `_arm_cofactor`, helper
`now_eval.prop_cofactor`): for a binary temporal with both arms purely
propositional, the left arm matters only on the positions where the right
arm has not yet fired, so restrict it to that care-set —
`φ U ψ → φ' U ψ` with φ' agreeing with φ on `{ψ false}` (W same);
`φ R ψ → φ' R ψ` agreeing on `{ψ true}` (M same, via `φ R ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ U ¬ψ)`).
φ' = Coudert–Madre restrict (`buddy.bdd_simplify(f, care)` — empirically
arg order is (f, care), NOT the manual's (d, f)) round-tripped through
BDD→ISOP, accepted only when strictly smaller. No temporal node
added/removed (Couvreur census untouched); wired after `_arm_unpad` in the
fold walk.

Motivating real case (polish/kinska sweep, 8ap-ba/randltl-10-a-hoa-5.txt,
source `h M e`): reference emitted `(e & !h) U (e & h)`; the rule reduces it
to `e U (e & h)`, which Spot prettifies back to `h M e`.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_arm_cofactor.py` (10 shape+equiv cases,
SUCCESS); fold/now/factor/context suites CLEAN; `test_random_equiv.py`
500-formula fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT (28% changed); `test_kr_r4_audit.py` CLEAN;
`tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — simplify rule 4: W/M expansion fold (DONE)

New independent fold in `fold_pass` (`_find_fold_or` / `_find_fold_and`,
commented there as logically separate from the X-unrolling folds): the
weak-until / strong-release laws `f W g ≡ Gf ∨ (f U g)` and
`f M g ≡ Ff ∧ (f R g)`, accepting the construction's ¬g-strengthened modal
body —
    G f         ∨ (f U g)   → f W g
    G(f ∧ ¬g)   ∨ (f U g)   → f W g      (sound: G(f∧¬g)∨(fUg) ≡ Gf∨(fUg))
and the duals to `f M g`. Body must be exactly f or f + a single ¬g
conjunct/disjunct; any other extra term makes G(body)/F(body) strictly
stronger/weaker (unsound, guarded + regression-tested). Trades two temporals
(G,U) for one (W) — an acc-set census win.

Chosen over a standalone pass (discussed): it IS a subcase of W-folding, and
inlining lets it compose with `_arm_cofactor` in the SAME bottom-up walk
(the U arm is cofactored before its parent Or is folded). So
`G(!b & h) | ((!b & h) U b)` → (cofactor) `G(!b & h) | (h U b)` →
(W-fold) `h W b`, recovering the source — the W/R analogue of the M-case
the cofactor rule already recovered.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_wm_fold.py` (10 cases incl. 2 must-not-fire
guards, SUCCESS); fold/now/factor/context/arm_cofactor suites CLEAN;
`test_random_equiv` 500-formula fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT; `test_kr_r4_audit` CLEAN;
`tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — simplify rule 4: GF/FG sibling cofactoring (DONE)

New independent rule in `fold_pass` (`_gffg_cofactor`, applied to boolean
nodes in the fold walk after `_fold_node`): under the cofinite invariant
`FG ψ`, the tail-only `GF φ` argument matters only where ψ holds —

    GF φ ∧ FG ψ   →   GF(φ|ψ)  ∧ FG ψ        φ restricted to {ψ true}
    FG α ∨ GF β   →   FG(α|¬β) ∨ GF β         dual (FG matters where β fails)

e.g. `GF(a&b) ∧ FG b → GF a ∧ FG b` (user's case). Care-set aggregates every
sibling invariant (`∧ ψ_k` for And; `¬(∨ β_k)` for Or), φ restricted via
`prop_cofactor` (Coudert–Madre + ISOP), accepted only when strictly smaller;
inner args must be propositional. No temporal node added/removed. Reuses the
`prop_cofactor` helper from the arm-cofactor rule.

Tests: new `tests/kr/simplify/test_gffg.py` (8 cases incl. Or-dual, nested,
2 must-not-fire guards — non-propositional arg + no-FG-sibling — SUCCESS);
all simplify suites CLEAN/SUCCESS; `test_random_equiv` fuzz ALL EQUIVALENT;
`test_kr_r4_audit` CLEAN; `tests/survey.py` SUCCESS 35/35.

## 2026-06-16 — wire own_simplify into the decompose recombiner (DONE)

The own-rules simplifier ran per kr-node and per leaf result, but
`portfolio/decompose._recombine` assembled the recombined And/Or and returned
it RAW — so a cross-part fold like `G(!b & h) | (h U b) → h W b` was never
attempted (no per-node pass ever saw that Or whole). Found via survey_diff:
the W/M + GF/FG rules unit-tested green but did NOT move the kinska sweep
output (`h W b` still emitted as `G(!b & h) | (h U b)`).

Fix: `_recombine` now runs `builders.own_simplify` (our rules ONLY — Spot's
tl_simplifier is deliberately excluded, it is not DAG-size aware) on each
part BEFORE combining and on the combo AFTER; the decompose recursion gives
both at every nesting level. Exposed a typed public `builders.own_simplify`
(wraps `_own_simp`: shared process bdd_dict, KR_SIMP_OWN size guard, no Spot).

Verified: `h W b`/`c W d` → source, `d R e` → d M e-fold, 8ap HOA → `h W b`.
survey.py SUCCESS (DAG 488→487); kr_r4_audit CLEAN; build_portfolio/
contract_combinators/options ALL OK/PASS.

## 2026-06-16 — LTL-definability gate moved off the sbacc form; Muller cap removed

- **Regression**: monolithic (non-`decompose`) cascade paths (`acc`/`weak`/
  `buchi`/`cobuchi`/`str`/`bls`) reported `NOT_LTL` for `GFa & GFb & GFc` — a
  formula written *in* LTL, so trivially LTL-definable. A false impossibility.
- **Root cause**: the gate (commit `fa900a2`) tested `IsAperiodicSemigroup` on
  the cascade's own `det_parity_sbacc()` automaton. Forcing STATE-BASED
  acceptance (`sbacc`) degeneralizes generalized-Büchi `Inf(0)&Inf(1)&Inf(2)`
  into a "which mark am I waiting for" counter — a real cyclic group in THAT
  automaton's transition monoid (GAP: 5 states, |T|=43, non-aperiodic), even
  though the language is LTL. Aperiodicity is a property of the SYNTACTIC monoid;
  the sbacc-inflated form is the wrong object. The same language in generic form
  is 1 state, |T|=1, aperiodic. The `conclusive = n <= sat_min_threshold` hedge
  was also unsound (small ≠ minimal, and `det_parity_sbacc` never SAT-minimizes).
- **Why `decompose` never misfired**: it splits the `&` into `GFa`/`GFb`/`GFc`
  *before* the gate, so no 3-way conjunct is ever degeneralized.
- **Fix** (gate on a sbacc-FREE form, before the build):
  - `language.py` — `Language` now HOLDS an `ltl_definable` `(definable,
    conclusive)` tag (`set_ltl_definable` / `ltl_definable`); it does not derive
    it (floor cannot import kr).
  - `kr/gap/aperiodic.py` (new) — `is_aperiodic_gens`: minimal GAP script
    (`Semigroup` + `IsAperiodicSemigroup`, NO holonomy), the cheap LTL oracle.
  - `kr/ltl_tester.py` (new) — `label_ltl_definable(lang)`: runs the oracle on
    `det_generic_minimal()` (deterministic, generic, SAT-min when small), caches
    the verdict on the Language. `conclusive` iff the form was state-minimal.
  - `kr/aut2cas.py` — the gate now runs `label_ltl_definable` BEFORE
    `decompose_lang` (skips the explosive holonomy build on non-LTL) and on the
    right form; the old post-build `casc.aperiodic` block + `_sat_min_threshold`
    are removed. One choke point for all cascade members (top + inner core share
    the single `as_translator`).
- **Muller cap removed** (`kr/cascade/config_graph.py`, `kr/options.py`): the
  good-Muller-set enumeration was capped by `KR_MULLER_SCC_LIMIT` (12), above
  which it emitted the whole-SCC set only — an APPROXIMATION that can build a
  non-equivalent formula. Removed entirely: enumeration is now always exact; if
  it explodes the run times out (honest), never approximates. The dead option is
  gone too.
- **Verification**: probes showed `GFa&GFb&GFc` 5-state/|T|=43/non-aperiodic
  (parity+sbacc) vs 1-state/|T|=1/aperiodic (generic); counting automata stay
  non-aperiodic on BOTH forms (no false negatives). R4 audit CLEAN. Survey sweep
  SUCCESS, 17/17 configs, zero `NOT_LTL` on the LTL corpus. Kinská sweep SUCCESS,
  strict improvement: 20 genuine `counting_buchi_*` cases that previously
  `BUILD_TIMEOUT` (build-first, then check) now report `NOT_LTL` quickly
  (cheap-check-first), 0 regressions. Reference baselines regenerated
  (`tests/logs/reference/20260616/`, kinská overwritten).

## 2026-06-16 — LTL simplify: completed the binary-modal expansion-fold quartet
The W/M expansion folds in `aut2ltl/ltl/simplify/fold_pass.py` covered only two
of the four laws (`f W g ≡ Gf ∨ (fUg)` at Or, `f M g ≡ Ff ∧ (fRg)` at And).
Added the two missing duals, both observed in real traces:
  - R-fold (Or):  `G(g ∧ ¬f) ∨ (f M g) → f R g`   (e.g. `G(!d & e) | (d M e) → d R e`)
  - U-fold (And): `F(g ∨ ¬f) ∧ (f W g) → f U g`
Both sound via the strengthened-body collapse (`G(g∧¬f)∨(fMg) ≡ Gg∨(fMg)`;
`F(g∨¬f)∧(fWg) ≡ Fg∧(fWg)`, the Gf branch of fWg killing g∨¬f). Each trades
two temporals for one (acc-set census win), same shape as the existing pair.
`tests/kr/simplify/test_wm_fold.py` extended (22 cases incl. must-not-fire for
the strictly-stronger/weaker extra-term variants); fuzz `test_random_equiv.py`
ALL EQUIVALENT, r4 audit CLEAN. README fold bullet rewritten to the 4-law quartet.
Other rules' duals confirmed accounted for (G/F absorption, GF/FG cofactor,
arm-cofactor U/W/R/M all present); the two deliberately-absent duals are the
S1/S2 W/M variants (unsound, regression-tested) and arm-padding's M case (sound
but never observed in outputs — arm-padding is empirically driven).

## 2026-06-17 — LANDED: result.py migration campaign complete; LTLFormulaResult retired

Completed the campaign tracked in TODO.md (steps 1–10). Every producer/combinator
now returns `aut2ltl/result.py::Result` (closed `Status` OK/DECLINED/NOT_LTL +
`credit`/`fuse`/`first` algebras per `result.md`); the legacy
`contract.py::LTLFormulaResult` dataclass, the `OK`/`DECLINED`/`NOT_LTL`/
`PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` status-string constants, the `_LEGACY_UNSUPPORTED` sentinel,
and `.conclusive`/`.note`/`not_ltl_definable` are all GONE.

- `contract.py` keeps only the `Translator`/`CascadeTranslator` Protocols, now
  annotated `-> Result`.
- `decompose.py::_recombine` reworked to the strict accumulator idiom
  (`fuse(start, *subs)` → bail-if-nok → fill formula), so a NOK fused with a NOK
  inherits BOTH diagnoses (the defect the user flagged: constructor-at-return
  dropped sibling reasons). `credit`/`fail` accumulate diagnoses via `_add_diagnosis`.
- `__main__.py` non-definability branch collapsed to a single `NOT_LTL` label
  (exit 3) printing `res.diagnosis`; decline test is now `not res.ok`.
- `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` collapsed into `NOT_LTL` (proof-vs-hint wording lives in the
  diagnosis text). The Language-level `(definable, conclusive)` verdict in
  `language.py`/`ltl_tester.py` is a SEPARATE mechanism and stays; `aut2cas.py`
  folds its conclusive/hint qualifier into the `Result.not_definable(diagnosis=)`.
- Removed `Result`'s retro-compat harness (the `getattr(other, "note", ...)`
  duck-typing fallback in `credit`) now that no legacy result exists.
- Retired stale test scaffolding referencing the dead type: `tests/sl/probe_sl_core.py`,
  `tests/sl/probe_sl_over_str.py`, `tests/test_contract_combinators.py`,
  `tests/kr/test_acc_translator.py` (git rm; revisit only if needed).

Gates: `tests/kr/test_kr_r4_audit.py` CLEAN; `tests/survey.py` SUCCESS (35/35
validated, 0 false, 0 declined, DAG=487 temporals=119 build=8.8s).

## 2026-06-17 — daisy: pure self-loop core extracted as a peer translator

Lifted the pure marguerite/daisy core out of `aut2ltl/sl/sl_core.py` (`SlCore`) into
a new sibling package `aut2ltl/daisy/`, peer to `partscc`/`sccdecomp`: `daisy.py`
(the `Daisy(child)` combinator — peel one daisy = STAY∞ ∨ LEAVE, delegate stems to
the child), `shape.py` (the structure helpers `is_daisy`/`split`/`reroot`),
`algorithm.md` (clean spec, lifted from the "Algorithm presentation" half of
`sl/algorithm.md`), `__init__.py` (context-free, contract-only — names no siblings).
Naming converged through `slpeel` → **daisy** (memorable structural metaphor over a
descriptive compound; sets up the "daisy chains" big-self-loop extension); technique
tag is now `daisy`. Removed `sl/sl_core.py`; repointed the four probes (`probe_sl_core`,
`probe_sl_over_str`, `probe_inv`, `probe_sccdecomp`) to `aut2ltl.daisy.Daisy`. Still
unwired (probe-only, as `sl_core` was) — no STATUS shift. Verified via the probes
(`a U b`, `inv` over it, `sccdecomp` over it): all equiv=True, tag `daisy`.

## 2026-06-17 — decomp/: regroup the (de)composition approaches, themed by folder

Created aut2ltl/decomp/ as a theme folder, one self-contained subpackage per way of
breaking a language into easier pieces (each with its own algorithm.md, its own
inline recombine — nothing shared by force; decomp/__init__ imports none of them, so
one approach drags in neither its siblings nor their deps):

- decomp/scc/        — moved from aut2ltl/sccdecomp/ (SccDecompose; tag scc<k>).
- decomp/strength/   — NEW StrengthDecompose: ∨ over weak/terminal/strong (Renault
                       TACAS'13, exact for any automaton; tag strength<k>).
- decomp/acceptance/ — NEW AccDecompose: ∧ over acceptance conjuncts, exact on the
                       deterministic generic-minimal form (tag acc<k>).
- decomp/inv/        — moved from aut2ltl/inv/ (Invariant decorator); its doc
                       README.md → algorithm.md for folder parity.

strength + acceptance are the two halves of portfolio/decompose.py's AND/OR split,
re-cast as separate pure peer Translators (portfolio/decompose.py itself untouched —
still unwired). Verified via per-approach probes: Ga|Gb (scc3), Fa|Gb (strength2),
GFa&GFb (acc2), aUb (inv), all equiv=True. CLAUDE.md project-layout line updated.


## (archived) aut2ltl/kr/TODO.md — folded into history 2026-06-17

The kr TODO had become mostly a done-list; archived verbatim here and git rm-ed.

# kr/ TODO

Forward-looking work items only. Current state: `kr/STATUS.md`. History: `git log`.
Construction reference: `paper/automata-to-ltl-construction.md`; ground truth:
`paper/Automata2LTL.txt` (Sec 4.2 + Table 1 + Formulas 3/4/5 ≈ lines 440–1040).

Context for prioritization: the FoSSaCS construction is implemented and
semantically validated (see STATUS). The thesis we are now chasing is that the
paper's double-exponential is a *flat-rendering* artifact: every case measured
so far builds a small hash-consed DAG in fractions of a second while only the
unfolded tree/string explodes. P0 below is the work that turns that
observation into a usable pipeline (and a SOTA claim).

## P0 — practice beats the bound (active)

Analysis, measurements and OPEN questions behind these items live in
`kr/dag_folding.md` (item numbering there: plumbing → vacuity pruning →
fold pass → interning). Items below are the actionable queue.

0. ~~**buchi2ltl on hash-consed `spot.formula` DAGs**~~ **DONE 2026-06-14.**
   buchi2ltl is now DAG-native end to end: `reconstruct_ltl` builds a hash-consed
   `spot.formula` DAG (t2 fragments included — `terminal_2scc` emits formula DAGs),
   and an adopted `scc_labeler` formula is spliced as a child node WITHOUT
   flattening. `sl_driven` drives it and its labeler returns the kr `spot.formula`
   DAG directly (no `str()`), so the kr-under-sl delegation boundary no longer
   flattens: `probe_sl_compose` all equiv=True, high-sharing cores stay tiny while
   kr-on-the-whole explodes — `XX(G(a->Fb))` 21 nodes vs 1.2×10¹⁴-tree,
   `c U (G(a->Fb))` 28 nodes vs TIMEOUT. Built as a temporary parallel module first
   and cross-oracled against the old string engine (MP ladder + randltl, 0
   divergences); the size census on the default decompose path is byte-identical to
   the pre-flush baseline (pure engineering refactor). The string engine and the
   cross-oracle (`reconstruction_dag.py`, `probe_dag_oracle.py`) were then DELETED;
   the engine was folded into `reconstruction.py` with the shared automaton helpers
   split into `reconstruction_helpers.py`. Gates green (r4 audit CLEAN, survey 70
   equiv=True / 0 fail). **Spin-off (agreed, next):** return a result struct with
   `.formula` + a `.technique` set (accumulating gate/and/or/buchi/cobuchi/bls/…)
   instead of a bare formula, and wire it into the surveys (see
   `[[technique-report-struct]]`).

1. **Fold pass — step A DONE 2026-06-12** (per-DAG-node memoized
   tl_simplifier, hybrid full≤2000-nodes/basics policy + reach dead-tail
   early-out): `G(p->(qUr))` distinct temporal 4115→559, `G(a->Xb)` tree
   85.5M→3.6M, `a&Xa` subproblems 752→311. Remaining candidates, in the
   order the tail-anatomy data suggests (probe_tail_anatomy.py: TAILS drive
   the explosion — ×2–10 distinct tails per level — not the avoid web):
   - ~~**B. letter fusion**~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (soundness:
     dag_folding.md "Letter fusion"; numbers: STATUS — XXa/XXXa collapse
     to the literal formulas, 3 survey cases flip True, G(a->Xb) under
     the acc cap). Remaining wall is fusion-neutral cases (1 AP, all
     letters distinct futures): `X(a&Xa)` 3.1×10¹⁰, `G(a->Xa)` 11.3M —
     they need C/D/E below or the 1c rewrite pass.
   - ~~**F. per-conjunct Fin-reachability fold**~~ **DONE 2026-06-13**
     (`config_graph.configs_reachable_from`, used in the Muller-DNF assembly,
     default on, `KR_FOLD_FIN_REACH=0` restores). For a good Muller set M keep
     `Fin(C∉M)` only for C reachable from M in the config graph (drop the rest):
     `¬Fin(C∈M)` forces Inf⊇M, Inf is strongly connected, so C∈Inf ⟹ C∈reach(M)
     — C off the cone is implied finite. Pure graph check, no containment.
     **Subsumes the absorbing-M special case** (M absorbing ⟺ reach(M)=M) and,
     unlike it, (i) prunes Fin(C) on non-bottom M and (ii) decides the kept set
     BEFORE building `fin_c` (the explosive part) so dropped configs cost zero.
     **Bites the distinct-temporal census, not just the tree**: no-fold→on
     (absorbing-only in parens) — `a U b` 87→13 tree, 4→1 temporals (literal
     formula); `F(a&Xb)` 4251→2739 / **74→64** (abs 74, no change); `(aUb)|Gc`
     637→525 / 22→18; `Ga|Gb` 7026→6438 / 47→46; `Fa&Gb` 187→159 / 12→11;
     `G(a->Xa)` →141; `X(a&Xa)` →4134. Audit CLEAN, survey 0 fail / no
     regressions. Still over the 32-acc cap where they were (`F(a&Xb)` 64) —
     the kept `¬Fin(M)`/reachable-`Fin` part dominates (census-anatomy);
     deeper census reduction is the open P1 acceptance-dispatch job.
   - **C. cascade-aware vacuity pruning** of the combined-letter enumeration
     (unreachable pre-configs, empty Enter/Stay) — prunes memo keys at the
     b^k base; soundness argument needed (see dag_folding.md OPEN).
   - **D. tail normalization** (canonical letter-word prefix + continuation
     form) — syntactic, internal, targets the wrapping count directly;
     expected partially subsumed by B (fewer distinct tails by construction).
   - **E. budgeted semantic interning** of small subterms.
1c. **Own syntactic rewrite pass — IN PROGRESS (kr/simplify/, 2026-06-12).**
   Rule 1 (context pass: sibling-context propagation over the boolean
   skeleton, identity domination incl. temporal nodes, Shannon at Or,
   context reset at temporal boundaries) DONE + validated
   (kr/simplify/testing/test_context_pass.py, 16/16 with per-case Spot
   equivalence). Rule 2 (now-evaluation: one-step unroll of G/F/U/R/W/M
   heads under boolean context, shrink-only, identity + BDD entailment)
   DONE + validated (test_now_eval.py, 18/18). Rule 3 (partial factoring,
   the sound form + Minato minimization of guard groups) DONE + validated
   (test_factor_pass.py, 10/10 incl. the draft-bug regression).
   ~~Pipeline integration~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (KR_SIMP_OWN per-node hook
   in _simp_f, persistent memos, size cap 2000, shared bdd_dict; numbers
   in STATUS — gates green, fuzz 1500 ALL EQUIVALENT).
   ~~Rule 4: unroll-inverse folding~~ **DONE 2026-06-12** (fold_pass.py —
   expansion-law pair folds + first-occurrence/induction + S1/S2
   Formula-5 subsumption; the census-reducing realization of the
   "eventuality-aware rewriting" item: F(a&Xa) census 55→33, G(a->Xb)
   flipped survey True; numbers in STATUS). Refinement queue:
   ~~Context-aware subsumption~~ **DONE 2026-06-13** (initial-state
   opening + ctx_subsume; F(a&Xa) UNDER the 32-acc cap, census 26;
   numbers in STATUS). Remaining:
   - **eventuality census, remaining**: F(a&Xb) still 74 distinct
     temporals (cap 32). Next: deeper-shifted ladder forms (only the
     one-step shift is matched), and the multi-AP variants.
   - **opening flow direction**: one-way (earlier→later in canonical
     child order) misses openings whose source sorts after the target;
     alternating the direction across the pipeline's repeated context
     passes is sound (each pass a fixed direction) and would double
     coverage — needs the direction in the context-pass memo key.
   - giant nodes are skipped by the cap, so the X(a&Xa)/reactivity wall
     is barely moved — needs either O(n) factoring on big Ors or the
     C/D/E fold candidates. NB the cap measures UNFOLDED tree size; with
     per-node memoized passes a DAG-size cap is the honest poly bound
     and would let the top of big formulas be processed.
   - fold pass changes memo keys → construction takes different paths
     (X(a&Xa) unfolded count moved both ways across tools); re-baseline
     the size censuses in kr/testing/logs/.
   - the 32-acc abort path in equiv children dies with free(): invalid
     pointer (teardown, cosmetic but masks the real verdict — make the
     harness report it as ACC_CAP). Background
   (user rule set, Java lineage): Spot's
   tl_simplifier, even at full strength on 5-node inputs, does NOT do
   present-literal cofactoring or guard factoring: `a & (!a | G(!a|Xa))`
   (≡ Ga) and `(!a & Xa) | (a & Xa)` (≡ Xa) both survive full simplify
   untouched (probe_guard_fusion part A). Candidate rules, sharing-aware
   per DAG node (the "grow our own rule set" hatch in ltl_builders):
   (i) cofactoring `a ∧ (¬a ∨ φ) → a ∧ φ`; (ii) Or-factoring
   `(g₁∧Xt) ∨ (g₂∧Xt) → (g₁∨g₂)∧Xt` + Minato guard minimize (catches
   tails that become equal only after simplification, which construction-
   time fusion cannot see); (iii) induction `x ∧ G(x→Xx) ≡ Gx` (riskier,
   parked separately).
2. ~~**Output representation**~~ **DONE 2026-06-12**: reconstruct returns the
   hash-consed `spot.formula` DAG; flattening is opt-in (`reconstruct_ltl_str`
   historical entry, `_str_f_gated` under `KR_FLATTEN_TREE_LIMIT`). The former
   CONSTRUCT_TIMEOUT cases now report measured sizes in seconds (`G(a->Xa)`:
   5.1×10¹¹ tree nodes from ~2k DAG nodes). This is the native input for the
   planned BDD-style analysis layer.
3. **Verification beyond Spot translation — now the verification front**:
   compositional checking (trace_fin is the per-sub-term oracle),
   word-sampling validator (ultimately-periodic u·v^ω, construction-ref
   pitfall #10), equivalence-based interning of subterms. Probed and CLOSED
   (2026-06-12, `probe_object_translate.py`): translating from the formula
   OBJECT (Couvreur fm / translator class) does not dodge the wall — one acc
   set per distinct eventuality (cap 32 compile-time) and the tableau state
   space is subformula SETS, which sharing doesn't shrink. So: either fold
   the distinct-eventuality count below 32 (item 1 + interning), or verify
   without translation. Spot authors are in the loop on sharing-aware
   translation; revisit when they ship anything.

## P1 — coverage

- **Acceptance dispatch per construction-ref §9.3 — IN PROGRESS, THE ACTIVE
  FRONT (orthogonal module `kr/acceptance_dispatch.py`). Resume here.**
  The Muller DNF (`Δ₂`, the default) is the explosive form; Theorem 2 gives a
  direct φ per acceptance class that drops the Fin web. Dispatch table (det
  class → frag → φ): looping-coBüchi/`Σ₁`/`⋁reach_to(ι,C)`;
  looping-Büchi/`Π₁`/`⋀¬reach_to(ι,C)`; weak/`Δ₁`/`⋁_G end_in(G)`;
  coBüchi/`Σ₂`/`⋀_{C∈α}Fin(C)`; Büchi/`Π₂`/`⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)`; Muller/`Δ₂`/full
  DNF. The looping/weak forms use `reach_to` (NO Fin); Büchi/coBüchi keep ONE
  Fin per accepting config (no `Fin(C∉G)` web, no good-set enumeration).
  - ~~**Büchi (`Π₂`)**~~ **WIRED on the default path — 2026-06-13.**
    `reconstruct_buchi(casc)` = `⋁_{C∈α}¬Fin(C)`, returns None if not
    `acc().is_buchi()`. Hooked as a TOP-LEVEL pre-check at the head of
    `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_BUCHI`, default ON; `=0`
    restores pure Muller) — NOT in `reconstruct_bls`, because the GOTO decompose
    front end calls `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` directly per piece, so the
    single pre-check covers both entries and fires per single-condition piece.
    α is COVER-AWARE (`config_graph.buchi_accepting_configs` off
    `build_pruned_config_aut`, not the lift-section `accepting_configs()`):
    the wiring exposed the cover caveat below — `F(a&Xb)` first went equiv=FALSE
    (`L⊊L(orig)`, lift α missed the duplicated accepting sink) and the cover
    reader fixed it. Gates: audit CLEAN, survey 0/35 FALSE / four walls flipped
    True / zero regressions, size A/B `G(p->(qUr))` 84→14 temporals (totals −22%,
    tractable-cases −61%); numbers + logs in STATUS. ~~Cover caveat~~ RESOLVED.
  - ~~**coBüchi (`Σ₂`)**~~ **WIRED — 2026-06-13.** `reconstruct_cobuchi(casc)` =
    `⋀_{C∈α}Fin(C)` (α = `config_graph.cobuchi_finite_configs`, the cover-aware
    DUAL of the Büchi reader), as a SECOND pre-check after Büchi in
    `reconstruct_ltl_paper_style` (gate `KR_DISPATCH_COBUCHI`, default ON). **GATE
    is the crux:** Spot's parity step hides coBüchi as `Inf(0)|Fin(1)`
    (`is_co_buchi()` False), so the gate recovers the natural acceptance via
    `postprocess(.,"generic")` and tests `is_co_buchi` there — and this MUST be
    measured UNDER decomposition (the raw `decompose_aut` view both misleads on
    the gate and overstates size: sat_minimize ~halves `FGa|FGb`). The
    `postprocess(.,"coBuchi")` gate is UNSOUND (GFa passes it). Results: `FGa`
    6→3 / `F(a&Gb)` 7→4 / **`FGa|FGb` 6195→2779 temporals** (still over the cap,
    UNVERIFIED — the residual is reach-driven) / reactivity `(GFa&FGb)` 10→7
    (its persistence AND-piece dispatches); totals −40%. Survey 0/35 FALSE, only
    `FGa|FGb`'s UNVERIFIED size changed; audit CLEAN. Numbers + logs in STATUS.
  - ~~**looping/weak (Δ₁/Σ₁/Π₁)**~~ **WIRED but OFF by default — 2026-06-13
    (`KR_DISPATCH_WEAK`).** `reconstruct_weak` = `⋁_G end_in(G)` (pure `reach_to`,
    no Fin; subsumes looping safety `⋀¬reach_to(sink)` / guarantee
    `⋁reach_to(sink)`), gate `is_weak_automaton(postprocess(.,"generic"))`, placed
    BEFORE Büchi/coBüchi (which else claim weak langs first). Correct (flag-on
    survey 0/35 FALSE) but a SIZE REGRESSION, so kept OFF: probes
    (`probe_weak_dispatch`, `probe_looping_dispatch`) show general worse 6/7,
    dedicated looping mixed (2 wins / 3 losses). The residual on weak cases is
    REACH-driven (τ-tail), which no acceptance form touches — looping just swaps
    the Fin-web for `reach_to` at the same cascade depth. Kept in as the A/B
    baseline for the Acc(c) idea below.
- ~~**config-indexed `Acc(c)` for the weak/bounded class**~~ **DONE — WIRED,
  default ON (2026-06-13, `KR_DISPATCH_ACC`).** `reconstruct_acc` = `Acc(ι)` by
  bounded unroll (R1 ⊤/⊥ Spot oracle on the small input D + R2 one-step unroll),
  SELF-GATING (declines → BLS on any recurrent config), first in the dispatch
  chain. **Cracks `X(a&Xa)`: UNVERIFIED 5.1×10⁸ → equiv=True, literal output**;
  whole X-ladder collapses to the literal; recurrent cases decline. Survey: only
  `X(a&Xa)` changed (UNVERIFIED→True), 0/35 FALSE, zero regressions; audit CLEAN.
  Numbers + logs in STATUS. Remaining items spun off:
  - **Replace the Spot ⊤/⊥ oracle with a structural test.** R1 currently uses
    `is_empty`/`are_equivalent` on D-from-q (bounded, small input, but a Spot call
    in the construction path — the one departure from "Spot for hash-consing
    only"). A graph test — q ⊥ iff no accepting state reachable from q; q ⊤ iff no
    rejecting behaviour reachable (on the deterministic complete D) — would keep
    the construction Spot-free. Soundness-check before swapping.
  - **Per-config (not whole) fallback at recurrent configs.** Acc currently bails
    the WHOLE construction to BLS on the first recurrent config (clean for the pure
    bounded fragment). A transient-prefix + recurrent-core input would benefit from
    splicing BLS/dispatch only at the recurrent configs (`Acc(c) = BLS-from-c`
    there), extending Acc past the pure-bounded class. Mind the cover/state-vs-config
    map when splicing (cf. the Büchi cover caveat).
- ~~**Last MP-survey wall: `FGa|FGb`**~~ **CRACKED by the buchi2ltl gate
  (2026-06-14): 2779→3 temporals, equiv=True; MP survey now a clean sweep.** The
  persistence-union the cascade/decompose path could not split is handled
  directly by buchi2ltl's backward labeling on the raw (nondeterministic) form.
  See STATUS "buchi2ltl heuristic gate". Spin-off items below.
- **buchi2ltl gate — wired, default ON (2026-06-14, `kr/heuristic_gate.py` +
  `decompose_recombine`). Landed; refinements:**
  - **Spot ⊤/⊥-style dependence is now just the bounded TGBA `postprocess` in
    the gate** (language-preserving, on the small node) — acceptable like Acc(c).
    No per-call equiv check (sound-by-construction, audited 0/0 over ~170 randltl
    via `fuzz_gate_decompose.py`); `KR_GATE_VERIFY` keeps the audit one env away.
  - ~~**gate-vs-split order**~~ **gate goes UNDER decomposition now
    (2026-06-14, `KR_GATE_UNDER_DECOMP`, default ON).** Decompose FIRST, gate the
    leaves; raw-form gate only when the root does not split (the
    determinization-sensitive cases — measured in `probe_gate_redet.py`). This
    fixed the honesty bug the size census exposed: a case `split_report` called
    `or(2)` used to be taken whole by the gate (`tech=sl`), now it actually
    decomposes (`tech=or+sl`). Size A/B (`survey_sizes_underdecomp` vs
    `survey_sizes_method`): wash (DAG 494→491, temporal 114→119) — OR-unions
    tighter (`Fa|Gb` tree 13→8), AND-conjunctions un-factored (`GFa&GFb` vs
    gate-whole `G(Fa&Fb)`, +1 temporal), all under cap & stylistically equal.
    Parked: per-node pick-smaller (build gate-whole AND decomposed, keep fewer
    temporals) would recover the AND factoring; not worth it at these magnitudes.
  - **technique reporting (`ReconResult`) — DONE 2026-06-14.** `reconstruct_decomposed`
    and buchi2ltl's `reconstruct_ltl` return `kr.recon_result.ReconResult`
    (`.formula` + `.technique` set), wired into both surveys' `tech=` column.
    Cross-package import edge (buchi2ltl→kr) deferred to a shared `util` —
    `[[technique-report-struct]]`.
  - **adopt rate ~81%** on random formulas; the ~19% it declines (and the
    UNVERIFIED giants) are exactly the REACH/cascade cases kr carries — the two
    paths are complementary, gate for shape-friendly + decomposition, kr for the
    systematic fallback.
- **Decompose-and-recombine at the root — LANDED + now the goto path
  (2026-06-13, `kr/decompose_recombine.py`; numbers in STATUS).** Both splits
  implemented and validated; `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` is the survey default
  (`KR_DECOMPOSE=1`). Sound because kr is language-faithful and a ROOT operator
  is a pure position-0 language op: `L(A)=⋃L(Aᵢ) ⟹ ⋁ kr(Aᵢ)` / `⋂ ⟹ ⋀`.
  - ~~**OR-decompose by STRENGTH**~~ DONE (`decompose_scc` w/t/s, union =
    language; Renault TACAS'13): `Ga|Fb` 499→21 tree (True), `(aUb)|Gc`
    6.97M→637 (True flipped from UNVERIFIED).
  - ~~**AND-decompose by ACCEPTANCE SET**~~ DONE (`top_conjuncts()` on the det
    acceptance; determinism makes `acc=⋀cᵢ ⟹ L=⋂L(A|cᵢ)` exact): `GFa&GFb`
    9.08e16→111 (True flipped), `(GFa&FGb)` 2⁶⁰→True, `GFa&GFb&GFc` unbuildable
    →compositional SOUND, `G(a->Fb)&G(c->Fd)` True at L=7.
  - Open-checks resolved: (1) the conjunctive form is `translate/postprocess`
    deterministic-GENERIC (not parity); split BEFORE parity normalization.
    (2) per-piece census is small (each single-Büchi piece ~10 temporals).
    (3) front-end wrapper `_to_split_form`→dispatch→`⋀`/`⋁`. NEW finding: kr's
    census is acutely state-count-sensitive, so `_to_split_form` must
    `sat_minimize` the det automaton (AUTOMATON-only — `GFa&FGb` 2-state
    postprocess explodes to 9.5e15, 1-state sat_minimize → 313).
  Remaining work:
  - ~~**export from `kr/__init__.py`**~~ DONE — `reconstruct_decomposed` /
    `split_report` exported; README documents `reconstruct_decomposed(aut)` as
    the recommended top-level entry (automaton in, formula DAG out).
  - **acceptance ABSORPTION** blocks both splits when Spot's determinization
    folds a second component into one set/strength: `GFa&Gb` (recurrence ∧
    safety → single `Inf(0)`, `none`, stays 89 temporals over cap) and
    `FGa|FGb` (persistence union → single co-Büchi, `none`, 2⁶⁰). Need a way
    to expose the absorbed component as a separate conjunct/strength, or a
    different split basis for these.
  - **n≥3 verification**: the recombined `⋀` trips Spot's 32-acc cap; the
    compositional check (`kr(pieceᵢ)≡L(pieceᵢ)`) is the sound witness — wire it
    into the survey as the verdict for over-cap recombinations (currently only
    in `probe_and_decompose`).
  Lineage: same root-soundness that makes `φ ∧ kr` sound when the INITIAL state
  carries an arbitrary φ; decomposition is that applied to ⋃/⋂.
- π-preimage exactness in the non-primary paths: `accepting_configs` and the
  config_graph fallbacks still map states through the lift only (the primary
  pruned-config-aut path is already correct via `state_of` = π). With covers
  real (duplicated sinks), the fallbacks should classify every closure config
  through π.
- Trivial (size-1) level collapse to reduce effective depth.

## P2 — feasibility

- Larger |AP| (on-demand letters or BDD guards instead of explicit 2^k —
  8 letters already multiply the combined-letter fan-out visibly).
- Hierarchy class tagging of outputs (Σᵢ/Πᵢ/Δᵢ per Lemma 5).

## P3 — testing & docs

- Extend semantic grounding from fin_c sub-terms to arbitrary reach calls
  (GT automaton for "reach T from S avoiding B" with β/τ obligations).
- More multi-level round-trips + size/depth metrics vs paper bounds (the
  DAG-vs-tree table in STATUS is the seed of the empirical argument).
- Finite-word variant (weak next in wsolid, construction-ref §10) — stretch.
- **NOT_LTL detection — IN PROGRESS (2026-06-15).** Non-LTL inputs (kinská
  `counting/`) currently get a WRONG formula from the cascade leaves (the
  holonomy group component is mislabeled `KIND reset`); SL correctly declines.
  Oracle: `IsAperiodicSemigroup(T)` on D's transition monoid (LTL ⟺ counter-free
  ⟺ aperiodic). Contract `NOT_LTL` / `PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` landed; wire GAP emit →
  parse → cascade flag → leaf members → portfolio/`__main__`. Conclusive only
  when D is state-minimal (`PROBABLY_NOT_LTL` above the SAT-min threshold).

## P4 — heuristic/kr mixin via suffix-formula injection (LOW PRIO, deferred)

Revisit only once the main census-wall path (P0 folds + P1 acceptance
dispatch) is stable. The idea: hand a hard component to a heuristic that
returns a formula φ_q labeling a state q of the original aut, then splice φ_q
into the kr reconstruction at the precise time points where the construction
"enters" q (config c with `state_of(c)=π(c)=q`; the config↔state map is the
traceability bridge — `state_of`/`state_to_config` already exist). Cleanest
realization: STUB q to terminal-accepting (its sub-automaton reduces to True,
the cascade handles the trivial residual) and conjoin φ_q once at the
`reach_strong(c,…)` arrival, UNDER the arriving X.

Conclusions from the 2026-06-13 exploration (what kinds of φ / side effects
work, and why — keep these; the exploratory code was reverted):

- The augmented language is `L(A) ∩ L(G(at_q → φ))`, `at_q` a deterministic
  state predicate. Always ω-regular; the question is whether kr can inject φ
  WITHOUT paying an exponential.
- kr has NO localized "language-from-q" subterm Ψ_q — it characterises
  acceptance globally (Muller DNF over i.o. config sets + reach/Fin). So
  "AND φ on top of what kr asserts at q" is well-defined as a LOCAL edit only
  where q's contribution collapses to one point: a terminal stub (Ψ_q=True)
  or a single transient (Fin) arrival. (Contrast: compositional
  state-elimination / the buchi2ltl backward labeling DO have L(q), so their
  `scc_fragments` splice is trivial — `buchi2ltl/reconstruction.py`.)
- SOUND + cheap to inject locally  ⟺  φ is ACCEPTANCE-NEUTRAL at q:
  * safety/invariant φ (small deterministic monitor; the extreme case is
    G(inv), a 1-state monitor) — does not perturb the Muller condition; only
    the loop encoding must be un-fused to expose the per-visit hook
    `G(at_q_letter → φ ∧ …)` (a size cost, NO exponential);
  * terminal stub — q stops participating in acceptance, so φ is asserted
    once at the single arrival.
- NOT a free lunch for LIVENESS φ at a RECURRENT q: the correct meaning
  `G(at_q → φ)` changes the acceptance question, forcing the product A×B_φ and
  re-derivation of the Muller condition. The exponential reappears in the
  product's recurrent structure — kr pays for acceptance, and renaming the
  liveness as "a formula on q" does not move it out of the Muller machinery.

Concrete from the attempt (reverted, recorded here): per-state downstream
invariants are computable by live-edge constancy on the aut (skip sinks =
states not co-reachable to an accepting SCC), validated against a semantic
oracle (`L` restarted at q ⊨ G(inv_q)); `a & XGb` is caught at the post-a
state (init has none). The GLOBAL front-end peel (project a forced literal
out of the input aut, run the chain, recombine `& G(inv)`; `Fa & Gb` 12→2
census, equiv=True) was DROPPED on purpose — it is the "poor man's" degenerate
case (init-config invariant only) and not the direction we want; per-config
injection above subsumes it when/if pursued.

## 2026-06-17 — session: tool-first docs, contract/combinator refactors, decomp/ + kr→bls reorg

Cleared from TODO.md as DONE:
- Root README rewritten tool-first (+ rendered example image docs/img/); aut2ltl/README.md
  source map added; bls/README rewritten as a current source map.
- contract.py split: Translator -> aut2ltl/translator.py (the floor, no implementor
  refs); CascadeTranslator -> aut2ltl/bls/cascade_translator.py; contract.py kept as a
  deprecated shim.
- combinators.py -> first_success.py. result.md folded into the result.py module
  docstring (the .md removed).
- decomp/ regroup: one isolated subpackage per (de)composition approach — scc
  (ex-sccdecomp), strength, acceptance (extracted from portfolio/decompose), inv
  (moved in). daisy/ extracted from the old sl_core (slpeel -> daisy).
- kr engine reorg + rename: members foldered (acc/weak/buchi/cobuchi/muller); operators/
  gathers the reachability operators + Fin(C); the reachability.py shell + README.old
  removed; kr/STATUS -> docs/kr_STATUS.md, the kr TODO folded into this file. Then
  kr/ -> bls/ (the BLS construction names the engine); the general member is `muller`,
  bls.py a deprecated shim.
All verified: CLI + tests/survey SUCCESS + the r4 audit CLEAN throughout.

## 2026-06-18 — heur/fuse2: extracted the size-2 SCC over-approximation (groundwork for retiring sl/)

The f2 size-2 non-accepting-SCC over-approximation heuristic (legacy
`aut2ltl/sl/heuristics/size2_overapprox.py::try_size2_overapprox`) moved to a new
theme package `aut2ltl/heur/` (pattern-matching heuristics) as `heur/fuse2`.

WHY: the portfolio rework wants `sl/` and the current `portfolio/` contents to
disappear entirely (all of sl is covered by `daisy`, a stronger version of the same
self-loop labeling). f2 was the one piece of sl with no daisy equivalent, so it is
lifted out first, cleanly, with no dependency on `sl/`.

WHAT: reframed HONESTLY as what it is — a gated TGBA->TGBA rewrite, NOT a Translator
(produces no LTL). `fuse2(aut) -> twa_graph | None`: find one non-accepting 2-state
SCC, unfold it once over-approximating the satellite self-loop to true, return the
result ONLY if `spot.are_equivalent` confirms the language survived. Documented
WIP/immature: best-effort, fires rarely, only ~30% of accepted rewrites actually
linearize into daisy reach (the rest stay multi-state, daisy declines harmlessly) —
the gate guarantees language equality, never the target shape.

CLEANUP vs legacy: `get_true_bdd` formula-translation hack -> `buddy.bddtrue`; one
200-line function -> four typed helpers + a thin gated entry; all F2_TRACE prints
dropped. `tests/heur/test_fuse2.py` proves byte-for-byte behavioral PARITY with the
legacy entry over the 100-formula f2 fixture (0 disagreements, 0 gate failures).

NOT WIRED: nothing imports `heur/` yet; the live pipeline + survey/r4 gates are
untouched. Decision: leave unwired for now, let fuzzing measure whether its absence
costs perf vs the current default before deciding to wire it.

## 2026-06-18 — portfolio/builder.py + simplify_ltl: the `best` recipe takes shape (--use best)

Started the portfolio rework as a NEW assembly file rather than retiring the old one
in place. `aut2ltl/portfolio/builder.py` holds named "recipes" (good assemblies found
in exploration) as convenience builders over the translators:

  bls(options)   = as_translator(make_hierarchy_class(options))  -- the cascade
                   engine lifted, with the cached LTL-definability gate in front.
  daisy(child)   = fixpoint first(Daisy(self), child) -- recursively peel self-loop
                   daisies, floor on `child` (the proven probe idiom).
  best(options)  = Simplify(strength(acceptance(daisy(bls))), "hi") -- the modern
                   re-expression of the historical Decompose/SlDriven/Decompose graph,
                   daisy in place of the sl envelope.

`RECIPES` maps recipe names; `build_portfolio` resolves a lone `--use best` to the
named assembly (recipes are whole assemblies, not ladder rungs). The CLI/survey can
now run `--use best` and variants head-to-head.

NEW COMPONENT `aut2ltl/simplify_ltl/` (Simplify Translator decorator): forwards to a
child, simplifies an OK formula (`lo`=own DAG rules, `hi`=+Spot tl_simplifier), NOK
passes through. Lives outside `ltl/` to respect the dep graph (a Translator must
import the contract floor, which `ltl/` may not). It GENERALIZES the two inline
`_simp_f(cand)` calls the historical `Sl`/`SlDriven` ran on their own padded output
(portfolio/sl.py, sl_driven.py).

SURVEY (--use best vs the default reference, 40-formula corpus): SUCCESS, 0
regressions, sound (39/40 validated, 1 Spot >32-acc wall). The one `hi` outside
collapsed the broad small-case padding (movers 17->5; several now SMALLER than
default). Remaining +138% DAG is essentially ONE formula: G(a->Xb) 6->101, because
partscc/t2 is not yet wired and it routes to the buchi cascade. NOT the default yet;
additive via --use best.

## 2026-06-18 — partscc wired into `best`: --use best reproduces (and edges out) the historical default

Wired `aut2ltl.partscc` into the `best` recipe via a `core` floor:
`core = first_success([PartScc(), bls])`, handed to the daisy fixpoint as its
delegate (`daisy(core)`). partscc labels a single terminal SCC — exactly what a daisy
peel hands an exit target — and is the modern replacement for the sl `t2` heuristic.

RESULT (survey, 40-formula corpus, `--use best` vs the default reference
tests/logs/reference/20260616_2/default.csv):
  * SUCCESS, 0 regressions, 40/40 VALIDATED equivalent (was 39/40 — the lone
    spot_err was the G(a->Xb) buchi blowup hitting Spot >32 acceptance sets; partscc
    (DAG 6) sidesteps it).
  * DAG 487 -> 539 (+10.7%), tree 1940 -> 2036 (+4.9%) — down from +138%/+1440%
    before partscc. Only 4 changed rows; 3 are WINS over the default (GFa&GFb&GFc
    -20%, (aUb)|Gc -15%, GFa&GFb -14%), one +1 node (GFa&FGb). Faster too (9.1s).

MILESTONE: `best` = Simplify(strength(acceptance(daisy(first(partscc, bls)))), hi)
now reproduces the historical Decompose/SlDriven/Decompose default with daisy in place
of the whole sl envelope and partscc in place of t2 — the goal of the portfolio
rework. Still additive (--use best); promoting it to the no-flag default and retiring
sl/ + the old portfolio contents is the remaining work (see TODO).

LOG NOT COMMITTED: tests/logs/best.csv is throwaway scratch (WIP), not promoted to
the reference baseline — promote only when best becomes the default.

## 2026-06-18 — simplify: strong-until/release as FG/GF invariant source

`_gffg_cofactor` (ltl/simplify/fold_pass.py) generalized: the FG/GF cofactoring
invariant source now also recognizes a strong `U(_, G(x))` on the And side and its
dual `R(_, F(x))` on the Or side, not just the literal `FG x` / `GF x`. Sound because
`φ U G(x) ⟹ FG x` for any φ (the strong until forces the eventuality); dually a false
`φ R F(x)` gives `¬φ U G(¬x) ⟹ FG ¬x`, the same `¬x` co-invariant `GF x` supplies.
Weak `W`/`M` are excluded — their `Gφ`/`G¬φ` branch breaks the entailment (regression-
tested as must-not-fire).

WHY: tracing the lone `GFa & FGb` mover where `--use best` was +1 over the historical
default (8 vs 7 DAG). NOT a decomposition difference — `and2` (legacy) and `acc2` (new)
run byte-identical splits and meet identical automata; the daisy leaf emits FGb as the
U-form `1 U Gb`, which the cofactoring rule did not see as an `FG` invariant, so the
cross-part collapse `GF(a&b) ∧ FGb → GFa ∧ FGb` never fired and the outer Spot pass
factored to `G(FGb & F(a&b))` (8). With the rule extended, `GFa & FGb → G(Fa & FGb)`
(7) through the simplifier alone — no per-leaf simplify crutch in `builder.best` (an
inner-`hi` experiment that reached the same 7 was backed out; the fix belongs in the
rule). best now ties-or-beats the default on every corpus formula: −49.6% DAG, 40/40
sound, 0 regressions, 0 size-losses (survey scratch tests/logs/best_rulefix.csv, WIP).
Gates: gffg 12/12, fold CLEAN(42), random-equiv fuzz 500/500 equivalent, R4 CLEAN.

## 2026-06-18 — simplify: algorithm.md spec, README slim, producer-first context order

Documentation + one behaviour tweak, all on the simplify package (`aut2ltl/ltl/simplify`):

- **`algorithm.md`** (new) — a decomp-style construction/soundness spec for the four-pass
  simplifier (context / now-eval / factor / fold), written by reading each module back,
  not from the README: the root-equivalence soundness model, every rule with its
  soundness hook, the pipeline pseudocode, termination-by-orientation, O(DAG) cost.
- **`README.md`** slimmed ~195→~60 lines to a source map + usage (mirrors `bls/README`);
  spec delegated to algorithm.md. Docstring cross-refs repointed (and the stale
  `kr/simplify` path fixed).
- **`context_pass.py`** — children are now visited **now-fact producers first**
  (`_open_rank`, polarity-aware: G/R/M at And, F/U/W at Or, strong before weak). The
  one-way opening (sound, anti-circular) made the result depend on canonical child
  order; producer-first maximises how many siblings each opening reaches. Free (Spot
  re-canonicalises the rebuilt node; tiny operand lists). Fuzz: marginally more
  reduction, ALL EQUIVALENT; survey corpus DAG unchanged (538), R4 CLEAN.

WHY: reviewing the simplify code while writing the spec surfaced the order-sensitivity
of the one-way now-fact opening — sound but order-dependent in completeness. The
producer-first sort is the cheap, principled answer (strong facts reach the weak
siblings that consume them); no soundness change, the fixed-order invariant holds for
any order.

## 2026-06-18 — tests/benchmark: the portfolio evaluation bench (collection phase)

A new sub-project to strengthen evaluation beyond the 40-formula survey gate: a SIZE
bench comparing portfolios (`default` vs `best`) at scale, reusing the survey engine.

- **`inputs/`** — raw file corpus, category subfolders, `.ltl` (one formula/line, `#`
  comments) / `.hoa` / `.md`-ignored: `core/` (the survey corpus by MP class,
  `from_survey.py`), `chains/` (W/U/R chains ± X-lacing, `patterns.py`), `kinska/` (105
  Büchi HOA, flattened + deduped from 125, `collect_kinska.py`).
- **`normalize.py`** — AP-canonical NAME form (rename APs to a,b,c… by first
  occurrence, NOTHING else — no simplification/reorder/minimisation), the dedup key for
  LTL and HOA. Deduped Kinská 125→105 (cosmetic key); whole corpus 164 items / 164
  unique.
- **`bench_sweep.sh`** — `default` vs `best` over `inputs/`, then `survey_diff.py`.
  Logs default to the gitignored `tests/benchmark/logs/`; reference runs committed
  under `tests/benchmark/logs/reference/`.

Engine/test changes this session, all landed:
- **survey summary reworked** for honesty: "aut2ltl answered X/Y (LTL built + not-LTL)"
  vs "Failures (timeout/crash/declined)", then a separate Spot-validation line
  (EQUIVALENT / not-checked grouped as "formula too large") with **NOT EQUIVALENT** on
  its own prominent line. not-LTL now counts as us answering; Spot's size wall no longer
  reads as self-doubt. Uniform across all sweeps.
- **`survey.run_build`**: a run that REACHES the budget is `BUILD_TIMEOUT`, not `CRASH`,
  whatever the exit code — the tool's SIGINT handler (proc.py reaps GAP, re-raises) can
  exit outside timeout's 124/137. A genuine crash exits fast and is still `CRASH`.
- **simplify**: `_gffg_cofactor` accepts strong `U(_,G x)` / `R(_,F x)` as FG/GF
  invariant sources; `context_pass` visits now-fact producers first; `ltl/simplify`
  gained `algorithm.md`; README slimmed. (Earlier entries this date.)

FINDING: the first full bench run flagged a legacy-`default` **FALSE** (verified
non-equivalent) on the strong-until chain `(a U ((a & b) R (b | c)))`, which `best`
reconstructs correctly — concrete evidence to promote `best` and retire the legacy path.

## 2026-06-18 — promote `best` to the default (portfolio pivot)

`build_portfolio(options, techniques=None)` now returns `RECIPES["best"](options)`
instead of `_default_portfolio` — so the no-`--use` path IS the modern `best` recipe
(`Simplify(strength(acceptance(daisy(core))), "hi")`, `core = first(partscc, bls)`).
WHY: the `tests/benchmark` first full run caught the legacy `Decompose / SlDriven /
Decompose` default producing a verified-FALSE (non-equivalent) formula on the
strong-until chain `(a U ((a & b) R (b | c)))` via `or2+or3+sl+sl_driven`; `best`
reconstructs it soundly (`daisy+strength2`, DAG 19, Spot True). Gated: kr r4 audit
CLEAN, survey SUCCESS 40/40 equivalent (all modern techniques), and the formerly-FALSE
formula now sound under the default CLI path. `_default_portfolio` and the legacy
`sl`/`sl_driven`/`decompose` rungs are now dead pending the architecture retirement.

## 2026-06-18 — retire the sl engine + legacy portfolio; settle the --use vocabulary

Full-modern cleanup on top of the promote-best pivot. DELETED: aut2ltl/sl/ entirely
(the heuristic backward-labeling engine — daisy subsumes its self-loop labeling,
partscc its t2 SCC heuristic, fuse2 was already extracted to aut2ltl/heur);
portfolio/{decompose,sl,sl_driven,options}.py (Decompose / Sl / SlDriven / the
portfolio.sl.* OptionSpecs); the aut2ltl/bls/bls.py compatibility shim (hierarchy_class
now imports muller directly). build.py dropped _default_portfolio and the
sl/sl_driven/decompose vocabulary; portfolio/__init__ is a modern surface
(build_portfolio/TECHNIQUES/RECIPES, _options seeded from KR_OPTIONS); __main__ dropped
PORTFOLIO_OPTIONS. VOCABULARY settled: the six producers acc/weak/buchi/cobuchi/muller/bls
+ recipe best — `str` became `bls` (the integrated cascade) and the old `bls` general
leaf became `muller` (its acceptance class). TESTS refreshed (one-time, per user):
deleted the tests/sl/ probes + test_sl_member + kr/test_decompose + kr/fuzz_gate_decompose;
rewrote test_build_portfolio + test_options; repointed test_fuse2 to drop the retired-
legacy parity (keeps the soundness gate). The curated example corpora already lived in
tests/fixtures (f2_successes still used by test_fuse2; t2_successes + terminal_2scc_labeled
kept though now orphaned). survey_sweep.sh + READMEs/STATUS/TODO/CLAUDE updated. Gates
green throughout (survey SUCCESS 40/40, kr audit CLEAN).

## 2026-06-18 — benchmark: fixtures import + AP-canonical corpus + keyed diff (LANDED)

Grew tests/benchmark from 164 -> 373 inputs and made the stored corpus uniform.
- WHY: the bench set was thin and inconsistently named (kinska HOA carried randltl
  alphabet letters like "g"; survey core used p,q,r), which muddied basic dedup.
- WHAT: new collect_fixtures.py ports tests/fixtures/*.py (formulas / f2_successes /
  t2_successes / terminal_2scc, 206 formulas after cumulative AP-normalized dedup vs
  the rest of inputs/ excl. kinska) + the 3 fixture HOA. The basic AP rename
  (normalize.py) is now APPLIED on store by every generator: collect_kinska (was
  verbatim), from_survey, patterns. No simplification/reordering — pure rename.
- Investigated the kinska "8ap" redundancy: it was a filename misread (randltl's
  candidate alphabet, not declared APs); the automata declare <=2 APs and use them,
  so remove_unused_ap was a near no-op (verified structurally inert) — dropped that
  idea, kept only the basic rename.
- survey_diff.py rewritten (pandas): keys on the input column, reports key-set
  overlap (absent-left/right, common, answered counts), diffs the common fragment.
- Sweep at 15s clean: 366/373 answered, 0 not-equivalent, 0 regressions vs the prior
  reference on the common fragment; reference baseline refreshed.

## 2026-06-18 — daisy2 (length-1 star peel) + best_daisy2 becomes the default

LANDED a new translator `aut2ltl/daisy2/` generalizing `daisy` by one level: it
peels a whole **length-1 star SCC** (a hub with petal self-loops, stem exits, and
one-hop spokes — each spoke a one-state daisy reached by `E_s ∧ X(G_s U R_s)`,
a strong `U`). The move-level closed form is not yet solved, so daisy2 emits a
candidate and adopts it only if a Spot equivalence oracle confirms it (the
`partscc` gate pattern) — always sound, currently **gate-rescued**. Design lives
beside the code in `aut2ltl/daisy2/algorithm.md` (moved there from
`daisychain/algorithm2.md`); the general multi-state design stays in
`daisychain/algorithm.md`.

Construction notes worked out this session (all in daisy2/algorithm.md):
- **S1/S2** drop FVS (hub given) and restrict detours to length 1 (the star).
- **S3** (keystone): acceptance marks only on the petals/links, never on the q1
  self-loop — checkable; makes revisit-of-hub a *theorem* (looping q1 collects
  nothing ⇒ non-accepting ⇒ must return) and makes acceptance a clean **per-edge
  `GF` anchor** at the move boundary (Target A, DONE).
- Open nut: the safety `StaySafe` is still the unsound flat-`G`; the
  position-0-anchored `Φ_stay` fixpoint (the hub anchor) is the single missing
  piece — it would also fix the acceptance phase case `GF(a&Xb)`.

PORTFOLIO: `best_daisy2` = `best` with the **daisy/daisy2 peel pair** (`daisy_pair`)
in place of `daisy`; wired `best_inv` (the global-invariant `G(Σ)` layer, which was
in NO recipe before). On the 373-case benchmark (core/chains/fixtures/kinska) all
recipes are sound (0 non-equivalent); best_daisy2 is −3.6% DAG vs best and turns
`!a M G(b|X(b R a))` from a 3804-node UNVERIFIED blob into a verified 16-node
formula. best_inv is benchmark-neutral on this corpus (~0.03%) but kept as an A/B.
**best_daisy2 is now the no-`--use` default** (`build_portfolio`); reference
baseline regenerated (DAG 538 → 414 on the 40-survey).

## 2026-06-19 — best_of brick + LTLResult.cost; best_inv_all experiment

WHY/WHAT. Landed `best_of` (`aut2ltl/best_of/`), the choice-by-size sibling of
`first_success`: runs every stage, returns the least-`cost` OK result (NOT_LTL
short-circuits as an absorbing verdict; DECLINED falls through; ties keep cited
order; winner returned unchanged, name is identity). A dedicated brick package with
its own README, mirroring `recurse/`. Added `LTLResult.cost` — the DAG-node count of
the result formula (lazy, cached, invalidated by the formula setter), the
provisioned "output size" field the result-contract NOT-FINAL note anticipated; the
metric import is local to keep the contract floor decoupled. `best_of`'s default
`key` is `cost` but is swappable. Unwired so far. KNOWN: `dag_node_count` is noisy at
the margin (the `(a U b) | Gc` inv case is 11→12 yet better-factored) — a switch
margin + a refined scalar are deferred (TODO) before wiring it into a recipe.
Test: `tests/test_best_of.py` (GAP-free) green.

Also added `best_inv_all` (`portfolio/recipes/best_inv_all.py`), an experimental
recipe weaving `Invariant` at every boundary (top, around `Acc` pre-determinization,
and per peel descent via `daisy_pair_inv`). Survey: sound (40/40 equiv, 0 regress),
inv fires on 16/40, DAG +0.7% (flat at survey scale; the pre-determinization strip
is a benchmark-scale lever). Default recipe pointer made a single re-pointable alias
`RECIPES["default"]`; recipes split one-module-per-file under `portfolio/recipes/`.

## 2026-06-19 (same day, follow-up) — best_of: pluggable Comparator, drop cost field

Reshaped best_of after the design firmed: the selection policy is now a single
pluggable `Comparator` (a `Protocol`, not a Callable alias) — `beats(incumbent,
challenger) -> bool` over two whole LTLResults. INTENT framed in its pydoc: all
weighed results denote the SAME language, so a comparator only ever picks a better
FORM, never changes what is expressed (sound by delegation — a preference, not a
gate). Walk is incumbent-in-order: first OK trusted, a later OK takes over only when
beats() says so. Comparators moved to best_of/comparators.py (the catalog): `smaller`
(strict-min DAG size) + `significantly_smaller(rel, floor)` (guidance margin:
inc-ch >= max(floor, ceil(rel*inc)) — strict on small, proportional on large).
DROPPED the LTLResult.cost field added earlier the same day: the two-result
comparator makes an embedded score redundant, and deriving size in the comparator
(dag_node_count(.formula)) keeps the contract floor free of the metric layer. README
extended: intent, a comparator catalog table, and how to configure/write another.
Still unwired. tests/test_best_of.py green.

## 2026-06-19 — combinator algebra, Step A: vocabulary (identity, compose, Decorator)

Plan enchanted-dreaming-hopper, step A of D. Named the decorator sort of the
combinator algebra: `Decorator` Protocol in aut2ltl/translator.py (Translator ->
Translator, beside Translator), and aut2ltl/compose.py with `identity` (the ∘ unit,
distinct from the decline terminal) + `compose(*decorators)` (outermost-first,
compose(f,g,h)(x)=f(g(h(x))), empty=identity). Free named combinators only — no DSL,
no operators. Additive (nothing imports compose yet). tests/test_combinators.py green
(identity neutrality, compose order/assoc/unit); r4 audit CLEAN.

## 2026-06-19 — combinator algebra, Step B: point-free recipes

Plan step B of D. All 5 portfolio/recipes/*.py rewritten from inside-out nested
constructor calls to flat `compose` terms, e.g.
best_inv_all = Simplify(compose(Invariant, StrengthDecompose, Invariant, AccDecompose,
daisy_pair_inv)(core(options)), "hi") — the two Invariant inserts now visible in the
list. Simplify stays the outer wrap (it takes the "hi" level arg). Pure move: survey
SUCCESS, DAG=414 unchanged, all --use recipes resolve identically. r4 audit CLEAN.

## 2026-06-19 — combinator algebra, Step C: unify the three decomposers

Plan step C of D. New aut2ltl/decomp/decompose.py: combine(connective, tag, parts)
(the shared _recombine = fuse + root ∧/∨ + own_simplify) and decompose(split,
connective, tag) -> Decorator (= recurse(λself.λlang. combine(...,[self(Language.of(p))
for p in split(lang)]) if split(lang) else leaf(lang))). strength/acceptance/scc
collapse from byte-identical class+_recombine scaffolding to one-liners over their kept
split fns: StrengthDecompose=decompose(strength_pieces∘tgba, Or, "strength"),
AccDecompose=decompose(conjunct_pieces∘det_generic_minimal, And, "acc"),
SccDecompose=decompose(<accepting_sccs+restrict_marks>, Or, "scc"). Behavior-preserving
(the three _recombine were byte-identical modulo connective/tag): survey SUCCESS
DAG=414 unchanged, r4 CLEAN. The .name class attr dropped (nothing read it; tags come
from combine's LTLResult.start). decomp's recurse body is a *combine* (∧/∨); daisy's is
a *choice* (⊕) — same fix, different body op.

## 2026-06-19 — combinator algebra, Step D: COMBINATORS.md + close-out (DONE)

Plan step D of D — campaign complete. New top-level COMBINATORS.md: the (almost-)
algebra over language-manipulators as a conceptual lens — carrier (Translators
faithful-or-⊥), the two sorts (translators / Decorators), the operations
(⊕ first_success / ⊞ best_of / ∘ compose / fix recurse, + the ∧/∨ combine of
decompose), the neutrals (decline terminal / identity ∘-unit), the ONE law (soundness
closed under every op) and the NEGATIVE laws loud (⊕ non-commutative, ⊞-with-margin
non-associative, fix no monoid), and the daisy(choice body)/decomp(combine body)
contrast. Close-out: removed the prepended COMBINATOR-ALGEBRA plan block from TODO.md
(A-D all landed), trimmed the superseded "recurse/fix combinator (idea)" item to the
still-open memoization lever, flipped the STATUS combinator-algebra note to done,
removed the algebra_todo.md scratch. Scope held throughout: free named combinators
only, no DSL/AST/meta. Whole campaign behavior-preserving (survey DAG=414 unchanged).

## 2026-06-19 — cake recipe: the liberal best_of (first best_of wiring)

First wiring of best_of into a recipe. cake (portfolio/recipes/cake.py) = best_of over
[best_daisy2 (trusted incumbent), best_inv_all (inv everywhere), an scc_variant that
finally wires the orphaned SccDecompose ∨-split], beats=significantly_smaller(rel=0.25,
floor=2). Liberal in ingredients, but the guidance margin only displaces the default on
a significant form win, so it is pure upside. Survey --use cake: SUCCESS, 40/40 equiv,
DAG=412 (vs default 414 — best_of harvested 2 significant wins, kept the safe form
elsewhere). Also defaulted best_of's name kwarg (="best_of") so it is frictionless to
wire. Not the default; curate the best*/cake recipe set later.

## 2026-06-19 — cake: decomposition BELOW daisy (the deep variant)

cake's aggressive alternative reshaped: the `scc_variant` (scc only above the peel)
became `deep` = compose(Strength, Acc, daisy_pair, Strength, Acc, Scc)(core) — decomp
BOTH above daisy AND below it: the peel now delegates its residuals to a fresh
Strength∘Acc∘Scc stack before the bls core, instead of the bare core (where the default
only re-peels). Terminates (the below stack floors on core, a leaf; no re-entry into
daisy). Survey --use cake: SUCCESS, DAG=412 vs reference default 414 (-0.5%, 0
regressions; one win: Fa & Gb 7->5 via the inv variant clearing the margin). The deep
below-daisy decomp did not fire on the 40-formula survey (too small) — it is a
benchmark-scale lever; here it is confirmed sound and wired. Diffed with
tests/survey_diff.py vs tests/logs/reference/default.csv.

## 2026-06-19 — cake slimmed: shy best_of, one cascade (partscc-floored rich variant)

Benchmark verdict on the 3-assembly cake: every win was inv (daisy+inv / inv+partscc,
none needed bls); the deep below-daisy decomp + standalone scc won nothing; ~1.8x cost
+ a kinska counting NOT_LTL->TIMEOUT from running bls TWICE per case. Reshaped to two
stages where best_of hides only ONE cascade: best_daisy2 (full core, run first so its
NOT_LTL short-circuits) + a RICH cheap variant weaving every technique
(compose(Invariant, Strength, Scc, Invariant, Acc, daisy_pair_inv)) that floors on
PartScc ONLY (no bls) — declines to the incumbent where partscc cannot label, so no
second cascade. Curated-40 survey --use cake: SUCCESS, DAG=412 (keeps the Fa&Gb inv
win), build 3.75s ~= default 3.7s (was 1.8x). Re-sweeping bench+kinska to confirm.

## 2026-06-19 — cake adopted as the default

After the lean (one-cascade) cake cleared the bar on the full benchmark — Pareto over
best_daisy2: 11 wins (-25..-41%), 0 regressions, 366/373 answered (+1 vs the old
default's 365), build 136.5s ~= default 140s; kinska size-identical (the lone counting
NOT_LTL->TIMEOUT is a shared 14s-vs-15s budget oscillation: the reference logs 14.003s
and the default itself times out under load) — repointed RECIPES["default"] = cake (the
single-line alias). Gate after: default resolves, r4 audit CLEAN, curated-40 survey
SUCCESS DAG=412 (was 414). STATUS updated. Reference logs regenerated under the new
default next.

## 2026-06-19 — daisystar (rejecting-star reachability peel); cakeds is the new default

LANDED `aut2ltl/daisystar/` — a peer combinator translator for the **reachability**
regime daisy2 deliberately declines. Motivating gap: `F(a & X b)` fell through every
structural peel to the bls/buchi leaf, a 181-node blob, versus a handful of nodes.
Its automaton is a non-accepting star {0,1} above a trivial accepting sink, exiting
the star from a SPOKE on the trigger b — i.e. the language is pure reachability.

The construction is the *easy half* of daisy2: when the initial SCC is **rejecting**
(Spot's `is_rejecting_scc`), no run staying in it forever accepts, so `STAY∞ = false`
**by construction** — daisy2's open `Φ_stay` safety closed form never arises. Only the
`LEAVE` least-fixpoint remains: `stay U ⋁(exit moves)`, with the exit allowed to fire
from inside a spoke (`E_s ∧ X(G_s U (h_k ∧ X φ_k))`), the return-excursion shape with
the return replaced by a spoke-stem. The flat `stay` region reuses daisy2's
move-level form, so `LEAVE` is still gate-rescued (Spot equivalence, the partscc
pattern); always sound. shape.py allows spoke-exits and ignores marks (the two
differences from daisy2's star_partition). algorithm.md is written in the complete
daisy-style (not the daisy2/daisychain draft style).

WIRED via `daisy_trio`/`daisy_trio_inv` (daisy → daisy2 → daisystar) in
portfolio/builder.py and a new `cakeds` recipe (= cake with the trio peels).
Benchmark A/B (default=cake vs cakeds, 373 inputs, survey_diff): **0 regressions,
10 equivalence fixes** (BUILD_TIMEOUT / UNVERIFIED_SIZE cases now Spot-verified),
**DAG −78.5%** (e.g. `(a U b) M XF!a` 23123→18, `F(Fa & (!a M (a U b)))` 18721→15,
`F(a & Xb)` 181→13); curated 40-survey SUCCESS, r4 audit CLEAN. Promoted cakeds to
`RECIPES["default"]`.

Also de-referenced the current-default recipe NAME from README / portfolio/README /
CLAUDE.md / STATUS CLI section — the single source of truth is the
`RECIPES["default"]` pointer; docs that named the winner went stale (best_daisy2 →
cake → cakeds).

## 2026-06-19 — daisystardet peer + cakedsdet default (LANDED)

Promoted the deterministic anchored read-off `DaisystarDet` from a sub-module of
`daisystar` to its own peer package `aut2ltl/daisystardet/` (daisystardet.py +
shape.py + __init__.py + algorithm.md, the spec history-free; reroot reused from
daisy, flat-LEAVE attribution corrected daisy->daisystar). Re-pointed
`RECIPES["default"]` from `cakeds` to `cakedsdet`. WHY: over the `cakeds`
reference the deterministic read-off is a clean Pareto step — survey -3.3% DAG (0
reg), 373-case benchmark 9 equivalence fixes / DAG -22.6% (counting_buchi
2150->13, several -90%+ cases), kinska -15.9% DAG (0 reg); the lone kinska
NOT_LTL<->BUILD_TIMEOUT diff is 15s-cap jitter, not a read-off effect. Audit
CLEAN, survey SUCCESS. Regenerated the three reference baselines (survey /
benchmark / kinska) under the new default. Also decoupled
tests/test_build_portfolio.py from the recipe name (asserts the "default" alias,
not a hardcoded name) so future adoptions touch only RECIPES.

## 2026-06-20 — never-regress round trip + ltl2tgba size guard

LANDED. New brick `aut2ltl/memo/` (`Memo`: transparent per-instance WeakKeyDict
cache, share-on-hit, identity-on-results; pushed). Recipe `roundtrip_best` =
`best_of([Memo(C), Roundtrip(Memo(C))])`, one shared Memo, registered `--use
roundtrip_best` over cakedsdet (naive `roundtrip` kept for A/B).

Guard: ltl2tgba dies on exp-flat formulas; the round trip fed huge SEEDs back in
mid-construction (real inputs tiny, so never hit before). `Language._base` now
gates the formula-translate via `_guard_translation` on unfolded(flat)-tree /
temporal-op knobs (env-seeded, tree 100 / temporal 32, 0=off; tree measured
capped at limit+1 since tree_node_count saturates), raising
`UntranslatableLanguage` (unchecked) before the call. `Roundtrip` catches it on
the relabel -> decline (best_of keeps plain); `__main__` catches the escapee
(e.g. user input over budget) -> declined bottom carrying the limit, prints like
a decline, exit 1.

Bug it fixed: at no guard, exp seeds -> false NOT_LTL / timeout / crash (7+9+1
across genaut/bench/kinska). Tuned 50->100 after 50 erased sound wins.

Bound=100 vs reference, roundtrip_best, 0 regressions ALL corpora: core +0%,
kinska +0% (seeds>100, parked = syntactic-decomp room), bench -14.7% DAG / tree
-94.5%, genaut -85.5% DAG / tree 1e32->9e8. Motivator aut_33300 seed 31 tree /
4 temporal -> 5 (collapses at any bound>=31/4). Audit CLEAN, survey SUCCESS.
5 commits on master, NOT pushed (memo 3 commits pushed earlier).

## 2026-06-20 — tests/ restructure, part 1: probes extracted + the import architecture

Began a large tests/ restructure separating three tangled concerns: the survey
HARNESS, the module PROBES, and the sample DATA. Part 1 extracted the probes —
and turned out to hinge on a question the plan never anticipated: how the test
code finds aut2ltl.

LANDED (one bulk move + follow-ups):
  * Moved the per-module probe folders (bls, daisy2, daisychain, daisystar,
    daisystardet, heur, inv, language, partscc, sccdecomp, the smoke scratchpad)
    and the root-level test_*.py unit tests under a single tests/probes/ home.
  * Decided the import architecture (the pivotal, unplanned piece):
      - `pip install -e .` makes `import aut2ltl` resolve anywhere (editable =
        dev mode = installed, same thing). setuptools gives a STRICT editable
        finder (maps only aut2ltl*, does NOT leak `tests` onto sys.path).
      - Probes are NEVER installed. They run as `python -m tests.probes.<...>`
        from the repo root: cwd carries the live source (incl. undeclared
        modules, no install friction) and sibling `tests.*` corpora resolve.
      - Consequently DELETED every per-file `sys.path.insert(... parents[N] ...)`
        bootstrap (~44 files) — the move had silently broken all the parents[N]
        depths anyway. The convention replaces them. Documented in
        tests/probes/README.md ("run with -m from the repo root").
  * Modernized the gate (test_kr_r4_audit): drop the bootstrap, locate
    reachability_operators.py via the module's own __file__ instead of a
    PROJECT_ROOT path. Runs CLEAN under `python -m tests.probes.bls.test_kr_r4_audit`.

CONSIDERED THEN DROPPED:
  * Extracting survey's bounded-subprocess runner (run_build core) into a shared
    survey/constrain_run.py for the probes' crash-isolation subprocesses. Moot
    once the only probes using that pattern were retired (below); survey keeps
    run_build to itself.

RETIRED (probe rot, surfaced by actually running them under -m):
  * test_kr_zoom — targeted removed internals (reconstruct_bls renamed
    reconstruct; aut2ltl.bls.reachability._compute_good_muller_sets moved to
    aut2ltl.bls.cascade).
  * test_kr_basic, test_kr_reconstruct, trace_fin_semantics — algo-invention-era
    scaffolding (hand-rolled subprocess crash-isolation + bootstrap, called
    reconstruct_bls). Superseded by the survey harness (end-to-end equivalence
    over corpora) + the standing gate audit. Retired with thanks.

BORN (step 3 started early, out of order):
  * survey/diff — the directional language-comparison tooling (ltl_diff +
    diff_hoa) turned out to be reusable HARNESS tooling, not module probes, so
    it left tests/probes/bls for a new top-level survey/ package, exportable as
    a module path: `from survey.diff import diff_report, to_aut` (lazy PEP 562
    re-export so running a submodule via -m doesn't trip runpy's double-import
    warning). This plants survey/ (the aut2ltl evaluation harness, a client of
    aut2ltl). Rename to aut2ltl_survey / pyproject wiring deferred.

PLAN REORDER: do step 3 (survey/) BEFORE step 2 (samples/) — the harness infra
(how it discovers/descends a folder, where it writes logs) dictates the shape of
the samples/ and logs/ trees, not the other way round. READMEs come LAST, once
stable; given how intense this refactor is, they will likely be rewritten from
scratch rather than curated step by step.

## 2026-06-20 — tests restructure, part 2: the survey/ harness package

Built the new `survey/` package — the aut2ltl evaluation harness, a client of
aut2ltl, run as `python -m survey` (eventually the `aut2ltl_survey` console tool).

LANDED:
  * bounded.py — the timeout --signal=INT/kill subprocess primitive (lifted from
    survey.py:run_build).
  * build.py — reconstruct one input via the front end, atop bounded.
  * verify.py — the spot-oracle equivalence stage, decoupled (takes is_hoa).
  * discovery/{walk,detect,read,scan} — recurse PATHs into Example(s).
  * techniques.py — resolve --use (opaque; `all` -> discovery TODO).
  * report.py — STAGED pipeline CSV: input|result|technique|build_s|formula dag
    temporals tree sharing|validation; row() merges the aut2ltl block + a single
    validation token; short-circuits left-to-right. Dropped class+mp.
  * run.py / cli.py / __main__.py (two-liner) — the orchestration + CLI.
  * diff/ — language diff (ltl_diff/diff_hoa) AND result-CSV diff (results.py,
    pandas, keyed by column name).

CLI contract: inputs via --ltl/--hoa/--folder (repeatable, mixable, none=>usage);
--logs DIR sends the one flat CSV to a file else stdout; verify ON by default
(--no-verify); --verbose adds the per-input trace. The GATE is now just
`aut2ltl_survey --folder <corpus>`.

SMOKED green: core/ (40 LTL, 40 TRUE -> SUCCESS) and a Kinska set exercising
every state (NOT_LTL / TIMEOUT / LTL+SIZE / LTL+TRUE). results.py self-diff = 0
regressions.

STILL OPEN (see TODO_REFACTORING.md): survey/normalize/ (from
tests/benchmark/normalize), pyproject wiring (survey* + aut2ltl_survey script),
retire tests/survey.py + sweeps, then samples/ (step 2), logs/ (step 4), docs.

=== 2026-06-22 — tests/survey refactor: samples/ + results/ + survey tooling ===

Continued the big tests restructure (split harness / probes / data). Landed on master:

- survey/normalize: `git mv tests/benchmark/normalize` -> survey package; absolute
  `survey.normalize.*` imports, no sys.path hacks. Then EXTENDED it: new `sweep.py`
  (shared folder engine: walk .ltl/.hoa + dry-run/--prune + tally), `dedup.py`
  refactored onto sweep, new `canon.py` (= dedup with AP-renaming built in, the
  maximal normalize), lazy PEP-562 `__init__` (kills the -m runpy warning). names.py
  stays for isolated print-only rename.
- survey/ltl2hoa.py (NEW): fill a peer hoa/ folder from an ltl/ folder via
  spot.translate ('small'/ltl2tgba); one .hoa per formula named <stem>_l<line>.hoa
  (traceable to the source line), mirroring layout.
- survey README/discovery README/CLI doc corrected to the real flag CLI (--ltl/
  --hoa/--folder, one flat CSV, stdout default), defaults header, CSV schema.
- samples/ (root, NEW): each corpus a peer, data + its own provenance.
  * kinska   -> samples/kinska (verbatim upstream clone); baseline -> results/reference/kinska.
  * fixtures -> samples/fixtures/{ltl,hoa}: the *.py formula lists became <set>.ltl
    (metadata dicts dropped, # comments kept); 4 hand-written hoa -> hoa/various/;
    hoa/<set>/ generated (315) via ltl2hoa. test_fuse2 repointed to the .ltl.
  * benchmark-> samples/benchmark; baseline -> results/reference/benchmark.
    collect_kinska/patterns curated to survey.normalize + new paths; from_survey +
    collect_fixtures + bench_sweep.sh retired. (inputs/ ltl|hoa split: TODO.)
  * validation-> samples/validation/{ltl,hoa}: the 40 (copy of benchmark/inputs/core,
    stale from_survey header dropped); hoa/ (40) generated via ltl2hoa. Gate corpus.
- results/ (root, NEW): persisted reference evaluations. logs/ (root) = gitignored
  scratch.
- tests/ now probes + unit tests ONLY: retired survey.py/survey_diff.py/
  survey_formulas.py/survey_summary.sh/survey_sweep.sh + kinska_sweep/kinska_breakdown;
  scan_corpus repointed to samples/validation/ltl; tests/README rewritten.
- CLAUDE.md gate patched: `python3 -m survey --folder samples/validation`.

Gates green throughout (validation 80 inputs SUCCESS; canon/dedup dry-run on benchmark
= 0; test_fuse2 0 gate failures). NOT done: benchmark inputs ltl/hoa split; reference-log
REGENERATION under the new default; root README/STATUS eval-link refresh; pyproject. See
TODO_REFACTORING.md.

## 2026-06-23 — survey source column, evaluation gate, tests/ curation, deployment

Closing out the tests/survey restructure (3rd session).

- **survey CSV `source` column.** Added a unique provenance key to every row
  (relative path | `file:line` | `--ltl:k`); `input` stays the readable, possibly
  colliding label. `survey.diff.results` now keys on `source` (dropped the old
  `input` keying that silently collapsed HOA basename collisions, e.g. kinska
  subdirs); only current source-bearing CSVs are supported (no legacy fallback).
- **Reference logs regenerated** under `results/reference/{validation,kinska,
  benchmark}` with the `source` column; no regression (identical LTL/not-LTL/
  TRUE/FAIL + DAG/temporals; build-time jitter only). Per-corpus CSVs overwritten
  in place; SUMMARY.txt folded from the old per-config `.txt`. `.gitignore`
  switched to a blocklist (only root `logs/` ignored; no blanket `*.csv` + the
  re-include dance).
- **`results/README`** added: the layout + the evaluation-gate refresh procedure
  (rerun into scratch `logs/` → `survey.diff.results` keyed on source → overwrite
  + commit only when clean: 0 regressions, SUMMARY SUCCESS).
- **tests/ curation.** `tests/README` rewritten as the probes-home statement
  (placed scripts, folder congruent to the module, run from root via `-m`; gate →
  `results/README`); documented the `survey.bounded.run` / `survey.build.build`
  budget+isolation harness API (reuse it, don't hand-roll subprocess/timeout —
  it survives Spot/buddy/GAP segfaults via `aut2ltl/proc.py`). `tests/.gitignore`
  ignores `logs/` + `probes/**/logs/`. Promoted 3 untracked `decomp` probes;
  removed smoke scratch.
- **Retired the kr-era r4 audit gate** from the daily process: renamed
  `test_kr_r4_audit.py` → `test_r4_audit.py`; dropped the gate citations from
  CLAUDE.md, the STATUS testing block and the tests READMEs (repointed to
  `results/README`); the probe stays runnable, just not headlined. Fixed stale
  pointers in `aut2ltl/bls/README` (dropped its gate citation — bls is a
  submodule now) and reduced `tests/probes/bls/README` to a simple source map.
- **Root README + STATUS** repointed to the survey/samples/results layout.
- **Deployment (pyproject).** `survey*` added to packages.find; `aut2ltl_survey =
  survey.cli:main` console script; `pandas` declared. `pip install -e .` verified.
- **Deferred:** the broad `kr → bls` code/prose sweep (dead import paths +
  engine-naming prose, a possible `sed` pass); converting the benchmark
  `samples/benchmark/inputs/` LTL examples to HOA (moved to TODO.md as feature
  work — the gateway to new-algorithm experiments).

## 2026-06-23 — FIX: survey CSV streams again (regression)

`survey.run` had regressed to collecting every row in memory and writing the
whole CSV in ONE batch at the very end (the timestamped file was not even
created until the run finished — `ts` computed post-loop). For a long
multi-technique `--use all` run that means minutes of no output and total row
loss on a kill/timeout. Restored streaming: `report.CsvStream` opens the file up
front, writes the header, and flushes one row per record; `run.py` opens the
stream before the loop (file under `--logs`, else stdout) and writes each row as
it is produced. Summary stays end-of-run. Removed the batch `report.write_csv`
(its only caller was `run.py`).

## 2026-06-23 — survey.diff.results: consistency gate vs quantitative assay

Split the result-CSV diff into two tiers. The CONSISTENCY gate (symmetric, the
only non-zero exit): a FAIL (formula verified non-equivalent) on either side, or
a CLASH (one run LTL, the other NOT_LTL on the same input — one is unsound).
Everything else is a QUANTITATIVE readout that never gates: answered/validated
counts, validation moves, result/technique changes, size movers, totals. The
prior code bucketed every TRUE->not-TRUE (incl. TIMEOUT/SIZE/ERROR) as a
"VALIDATION REGRESSION" and exited 1 — conflating "oracle couldn't verify a huge
but still-correct formula" with "formula was wrong". A bigger tree or a
TRUE->TIMEOUT move is now an assay, not a regression. Gate test:
tests/probes/test_diff_results.py.

## 2026-06-24 — roundtrip generalized to the Rewriter contract; roundtrip_decomp + recipe

Reframed the round-trip family around a formula-space contract.

- `aut2ltl/ltl_rewriter/` — new contract `Rewriter = LTLResult -> LTLResult`
  (faithful `R(r) ≡ r`, decline kept, `identity` floor). Boundary adapters
  `relabel(Λ)` (Translator -> Rewriter) and `as_translator(seed, R)` (Rewriter ->
  Translator); `simplify` lifts own_simplify, crediting only on change.
- `aut2ltl/roundtrip_top/` — the prior whole-seed round-trip brick, renamed off
  `roundtrip/` (recipes repointed); unchanged behaviour.
- `aut2ltl/roundtrip/` — rebuilt as the Rewriter `roundtrip(R, Φ)` (no seed):
  locate `n = Φ(φ)`, re-present `φ↓n` with R, relink via `subst`. `cutpoints/`
  finders `root`, `toplevel(operator)`; `Finder` protocol; `subst` (φ[n↦ψ]).
- `aut2ltl/roundtrip_decomp/` — the Rewriter `roundtrip_decomp(R, Φ)`: locate N,
  re-present each distinct operand of N (helper `rewrite_each`), rebuild N once,
  one `subst`. Rebuild-once => operands rewritten as independent formulas, no
  in-flight hash-cons identity invalidated; per-operand faithfulness + congruence.
- `--use roundtrip_decomp` recipe: `Simplify(as_translator(cakedsdet,
  roundtrip_decomp(best_of(identity, relabel(cakedsdet)), toplevel(And))), "hi")`.
  NOT yet exercised — first run / survey deferred to next session (see TODO).

## 2026-06-24 — roundtrip_decomp rebuild fix + Rewriter attribution rule

DONE. Exercising `--use roundtrip_decomp` over the four corpora (validation/kinska/
benchmark/genaut) surfaced a `KeyError` crash on `GF(a & Xa)` (benchmark): the recipe's
rebuild deduped operands via `dict.fromkeys(node)` (idempotency only safe for ∧/∨) and
then `node.map`'d back by child VALUE — but a re-presentation can drift a shared child
instance out from under a value-keyed map. Fixed by snapshotting operands in order
(repeats kept) and feeding the re-presented results back POSITIONALLY
(`roundtrip_decomp.py`); algorithm.md aligned. Crash gone; benchmark back to green
(crash 1→0, validated 255→255), the 3 roundtrip_decomp size wins (−54/−50/−44%) intact,
`GF(a & Xa)` now LTL at +1 DAG node (margin noise). validation/kinska stayed clean+neutral.

LANDED. Promoted the "no-op ⇒ no credit" attribution rule from an ad-hoc per-rewriter
habit to the `ltl_rewriter` CONTRACT (Rewriter Protocol docstring + algorithm.md): a
Rewriter whose output formula is hash-cons-identical to its input MUST return the input
verbatim, crediting neither itself nor a delegate. `simplify`/`roundtrip_decomp`/`identity`
already honored it; brought `roundtrip` (added the `inner.formula == node` guard) and
`relabel` (added the `out.formula == res.formula` guard) into line. Tag-only change — no
chosen formula's size or equivalence moves — so the adoption comparison is unaffected.
Adoption decision (promote roundtrip_decomp to default) pending the genaut result.

## 2026-06-24 — root cause of the genaut LTL->TIMEOUT: str(f) intern key

DONE. The 5 genaut `LTL -> TIMEOUT` regressions under `--use roundtrip_decomp` were
NOT ltl2tgba blowups. Instrumenting `Language.of_ltl` (a temporary
`AUT2LTL_LANG_TRACE_DIR` dump + per-line wall deltas) showed the hang was in
`of_ltl` BEFORE any translate: the intern key was `str(f)`, which flattens the
hash-consed formula — O(unfolded tree), exponential on a shared DAG. A
roundtrip_decomp-re-presented operand had a tiny DAG but a 37 MB (and growing) flat
string; building that string for the cache key was the multi-minute hang. ltl2tgba
never ran (the temporal>32 / tree>100 guard refuses these). Fixed by keying on the
O(DAG) `dag_md5(f)` (full 32-hex; the same fingerprint `--dagmd5` / the survey use)
— identity-preserving (equal formula <=> equal str <=> equal dag_md5), so results are
unchanged, only the flatten is gone. All 5 inputs now complete (buchi answers, large
but finite); default validation gate stayed SUCCESS (DAG 472, unchanged).

LANDED. The heavy diagnostic trace was lightened to one opt-in knob
`AUT2LTL_LANG_TRACE`: a single stderr line per `formula.translate()` with wall time
and DAG-only sizes (never a flatten) — the runtime probe kept, the file-dump
scaffolding dropped. Principle recorded at the key site: str/flatten is print-only
and size-gated (`ltl/printers.format_gated`); a Language's identity is the O(DAG)
dag_md5. Genaut roundtrip_decomp re-run (to confirm the 5 resolved + no new moves)
and the adoption decision are pending.

## 2026-06-24 — buchi is the blob factory; nobls recipe + recoverability probe

DONE (research finding). To test whether internal shared subformulas of a giant-DAG
result are recoverable+smaller by round trip, added
`tests/probes/roundtrip/probe_shared_nodes.py`: walk the DAG, pick >1-parent nodes,
round-trip each (under the Language.of translate bound) via survey --no-verify with a
severe SIGKILL. On aut_10380's default formula (1704 DAG nodes, 463 shared, 116
translatable): 38 nodes come back SMALLER (e.g. 30->9), 50 same, 21 BIGGER, 7 timeout.
EVERY severe blowup (x24..x1247; a 14-node U-language -> 10912 nodes) was a `buchi`
answer (`buchi+daisy[+...]`); the daisy/partscc/daisystar/inv layers produced all the
compact + shrinking forms, cheaply (~0.11s vs 1-4s for the buchi blobs).

LANDED. `nobls` recipe (`portfolio/recipes/nobls.py`): the rich decomposition stack
over `daisy_trio_det_inv` floored on `PartScc` ALONE (no bls). Re-running the probe
with the dance under `--use nobls`: the 38 shrinks and 50 same-size recoveries are
UNCHANGED, the 21 buchi blowups become clean DECLINES, 0 timeouts, 5.5x less total
time (13s vs 72s). Confirms: the bls cascade (buchi) is the sole source of the severe
round-trip blowups; nobls trades "blob answer" for "clean decline", leaving such
sub-languages for a round trip. roundtrip_decomp NOT adopted as default (still
maturing); nobls is a building block toward a roundtrip-floored-on-nobls assembly.

## 2026-06-24 — deep_roundtrip / deep_nobls

Deep bottom-up round trip lands. Probe (tests/probes/roundtrip/probe_shared_nodes.py)
showed buchi is the sole round-trip blob factory; nobls declines instead. deep_roundtrip
(roundtrip_deep/) re-presents every DAG node bottom-up, memoized on hash-consed identity.
deep_nobls = cakedsdet seed + deep_roundtrip(best_of([identity, relabel(nobls)])).
aut_10380: 1704 -> 1470 (@tree100) -> 1189 (@tree1000, -30%). Raising tree safe; temporal>32
is not (spot runs wild). In-process ceiling ~tree=1000; past it a signal-deaf translate hangs
the fold (probe survives via per-node subprocess SIGKILL). Next: per-translate external
timeout. See research_notes/deep_roundtrip.md.

## 2026-06-25 — definability gate isolated; non-LTL witness module begun (in the making)

ISOLATED the LTL-definability gate into its own package `bls/definability/`
(`git mv bls/ltl_tester.py -> bls/definability/tester.py`, package `__init__`,
rewired the sole consumer `aut2cas` and the stale path refs in `gap/aperiodic`).
The GAP scripts stay in `bls/gap/` and the Spot->generators extraction stays in
`bls/extract.py` (both shared with the cascade holonomy). Gate-green on validation
(80/80) and kinska (165, no regression).

WROTE `bls/definability/algorithm.md` (daisy/inv register), then revised it twice
per review: (1) sober/factual register — non-LTL is a hard fail (NOT_LTL ≻ DECLINED
short-circuits first_success and dominates composition), and the former "fail-open"
is reframed as the gate ABSTAINING only when the oracle physically cannot run
(returns (True,False) so the cascade is attempted, never a fabricated verdict); it
stays sound because gate and cascade share extract+GAP, so whatever stops the gate
dooms the cascade to decline. (2) contract-first structure grounded against the
actual code (det_generic_minimal = postprocess deterministic generic + sat_minimize
when small + complete in the gate), with "why not the cascade's sbacc form" split
into its own section.

BEGAN the non-LTL WITNESS module `bls/definability/witness/` (the "name the kernel"
work; see research_notes/non_ltl_certificates.md). algorithm.md + stage-1 source:
`extract_witness(lang)` reads the same form as the gate, and on the non-aperiodic
branch drives a NEW witness-only GAP script `bls/gap/witness_group.py` (find a
non-trivial group H-class, take a non-identity element g, its order p = period,
factorize g over the generators) and lifts the factorization back to the period
word v over concrete letters. Returns Witness(p, v, factor); None when no group.
Additive only: nothing existing modified, the gate (tester.py) untouched, helpers
reused read-only / orchestration cloned (refactor-to-share deferred until both work).
u/x family completion and witness verification are still to come.

UNIT TEST `tests/probes/witness/test_witness.py` (counter example parity_a.hoa ->
witness p=2, lifted v induces a 2-orbit; LTL control GFa -> no witness). Fixed one
GAP syntax bug found via direct-stderr replay: `QUIT;` cannot sit inside an if/fi
block — moved to top level (the aperiodic.py pattern).

ALSO present (uncommitted, earlier in session): a membership-tier certificate
verifier prototype under `tests/probes/certificate/` — replays u.v^n.x membership
on the INPUT automaton via Spot, the "suggestive" tier (distinguishability, not yet
periodicity).

## 2026-06-25 (cont.) — witness stage 2 (u/x) + first corpus witnesses

STAGE 2 of the non-LTL witness: `extract_witness(lang, complete=True)` now
synthesises the family completion from the automaton. `u` is a BFS letter-word to a
state on a non-trivial `v`-orbit; `x` is a phase-discriminating lasso between
adjacent orbit phases, taken from `product(L_q, complement(L_q')).accepting_word()`
and rendered to dict-independent letter strings so it replays on the INPUT
automaton. `Witness` gained `u` / `x_prefix` / `x_cycle` and a `complete` flag. On
the counter example the fully self-generated family is u='a', v='a', x='a;(!a)^w',
p=2, toggling 10101.

VALIDATED on real corpus inputs: four kinska `1ap` counting automata known NOT_LTL
and fast (~0.62s) from `samples/benchmark/inputs/kinska/` — all p=2 / v=a, each
synthesised family verified to toggle on the input automaton. Single-input probe
`tests/probes/witness/witness_on_hoa.py`. Logged in `research_notes/witness_log.md`
(new running lab log) with repro commands and a results table; `non_ltl_certificates.md`
status table + §10 updated (witness extraction now built).

OPEN / NEXT (for a fresh session): (1) pin the GAP right-action order on a p>=3 case
— all 1ap counting are p=2, which hides a reversal; need higher-AP counting or a
mod-3 fixture. (2) minimise u/x. (3) the periodicity-proof tier (residual-equivalence
query) to upgrade the suggestive membership replay to a proof. (4) wire the Witness
onto the NOT_LTL result as a diagnosis complement in aut2cas (gate path untouched).
(5) DEFERRED ADMIN the user asked to delay: move the witness probes under
`tests/probes/bls/definability/witness/` (mirror the source tree), give the verifier
its own folder, and drop the "certificate" naming (the object is a *witness*).

## 2026-06-25 — non-LTL witness: GAP right-action order pinned (p ≥ 3)

DONE. The witness lift (`witness/_induced_transform`) reads a GAP `Factorization`
index word left-to-right in the image-list convention; this is correct only if it
matches GAP's right-action product, else the period word `v` comes out reversed
(non_ltl_certificates §4 gotcha). A period-2 cycle is self-inverse and a
single-letter factor is a palindrome, so neither the prior `parity_a` (p=2) case nor
the kinska 1ap witnesses could test the *direction*.

LANDED (all additive, nothing existing edited):
- `samples/fixtures/hoa/various/mod3_a.hoa` (+ generator
  `tests/probes/bls/definability/witness/make_mod3_fixture.py`) — `L = a^{3k}(!a)ᵒ`,
  the first p ≥ 3 non-LTL input; `extract_witness` returns a genuine period-3 witness
  (factor `a;a`, toggle `1001001`).
- `aut2ltl/bls/gap/witness_eval.py` — `eval_word(gens, word)`, GAP's right-action
  product as a 0-based image list: the independent oracle.
- `aut2ltl/bls/definability/witness/pin.py` — `check_action_order(lang)` → `PinResult`,
  comparing `_induced_transform` to `eval_word` on the real factor and on a constructed
  direction-sensitive word (reversal induces a different transform — what a palindrome
  cannot exercise). Probe `tests/probes/bls/definability/witness/pin_order.py`.

RESULT: PINNED on mod3_a (p=3) and parity_a (p=2). Forward matches GAP, reversal
differs — the lift composes left-to-right, no reversal bug. `test_witness` 4/4.
Notes: research_notes/non_ltl_certificates.md §8/§10, research_notes/witness_log.md.
Open: minimise u/x; periodicity-proof tier; wire Witness into the NOT_LTL result.

## 2026-06-25 — non-LTL witness wired into main; gate extracted from aut2cas

DONE. The non-LTL witness now reaches the user: `python3 -m aut2ltl <non-LTL>`
prints the counting family `(u, v, x, p)` beneath the NOT_LTL diagnosis (exit 3),
suppressible with `KR_PRODUCE_WITNESS=0`.

Architecture (decorator over a pure adapter):
- `aut2ltl/witness.py` (NEW, floor) — the `Witness` value type, lifted out of
  `bls/definability/witness/witness.py` (which keeps only `extract_witness` + helpers).
  Pure data + `summary()`; the floor can type-mention it without engine deps.
- `aut2ltl/result.py` — `LTLResult` gains a `witness` slot: set only via the
  `not_definable` factory (single injection point), propagated by `credit` (first
  wins), absent on OK/DECLINED, untouched by `fail`. Type-mentioned under TYPE_CHECKING.
- `bls/definability/tester.py` -> `tester/` package (peer to `witness/`).
- `bls/definability/gate.py` (NEW) — `definability_gate(inner)`: the NOT_LTL border.
  On the non-definable branch builds the LTLResult (prose diagnosis + knob-guarded,
  best-effort witness), else delegates. Orchestrates `tester/` + `witness/` (so
  neither depends on the other).
- `bls/aut2cas.py` — now a PURE cascade adapter (gate, NOT_LTL construction, and the
  reconstruct singleton removed). Portfolio (`build.py`, `builder.py`) and the
  `reconstruct` endpoint (in `bls/__init__.py`) compose `definability_gate(as_translator(…))`.
- `bls/options.py` — `kr.produce_witness` knob (default on). `__main__.py` prints
  `res.witness.summary()`.

Rationale: bricks make no caller assumptions (ungated `as_translator` stays reusable;
the gate is a separate brick composed at the use site). The witness travels the same
chain as the diagnosis (LTLResult -> credit -> main); the Language verdict cache stays
the downstream fail-safe boolean (no witness there).

Verification: `samples/validation` survey SUCCESS (80/80 TRUE); `test_result_witness`
6/6; `test_witness` 4/4; `pin_order` PINNED. Notes:
research_notes/non_ltl_certificates.md §8/§10, research_notes/witness_log.md.
Open: minimise u/x; periodicity-proof tier; multi-factor sets / atlas (§6/§7).

## 2026-06-25 — operators: adopt the reference names, split one file per operator, doc

DONE. Made the cascade's reachability core speak the construction reference's language
and split the 652-line module into one file per operator, with a proper algorithm.md.

- **Paper relocated.** `paper/` → `aut2ltl/bls/paper/` (mechanical; the cascade's
  reference now sits next to its code; relative links inside bls/README resolve again).
- **Rename sweep (behavior-preserving).** reach_strong→reach, reach_weak→wreach,
  _solid_stay_strong→solid, _stay_gt0_strong→solid_plus, _solid_stay_weak→wsolid,
  _stay_gt0_weak→wsolid_plus, _dashed_change_strong→dashed (word-boundary sed across 9
  files incl. the r4 audit probe). Survey SUCCESS, identical totals (DAG=472,
  temporals=128); r4 audit CLEAN.
- **One file per operator.** reachability_operators.py → reach.py / wreach.py /
  solid.py / wsolid.py / dashed.py; non-recursive machinery (memo decorator,
  combined-letter enumeration, fusion, builder re-exports) in support.py. Mutual
  recursion carried by module-qualified calls (from . import sibling; sibling.fn()),
  cycle-safe. operators/__init__ is the facade re-exporting the whole surface so
  callers don't see the split; fin/weak/muller/probes repointed to it. The r4 audit
  reads per-operator source via importlib (no function reflection). Survey SUCCESS,
  identical totals.
- **operators/algorithm.md** — one section per operator aired from the digest
  (paper/automata-to-ltl-construction.md), cites Boker–Lehtinen–Sickert FoSSaCS'22,
  plus a separated "Beyond the paper" section: hash-consing/per-build memo, letter
  enumeration+fusion (observable h-image, dedupe, Minato-OR), early-outs, and the
  consumer-side Fin-conjunct fold (pointer to muller).
- Doc tidy: CLAUDE.md drops the paper pointers; README folder-map slimmed to top level;
  bls/README refreshed (definability/ replaces ltl_tester.py, docs/ refs dropped);
  stale reachability_operators references repointed to the operators package.

## 2026-06-25 — operators code review (pass over the split files)

Reviewing the sed-carved operator files against the new algorithm.md, removing
progress-log / refactor-history cruft and tightening structure (behavior-preserving;
survey SUCCESS with identical totals DAG=472/temporals=128 at each logic-touching step):

- **support.py** — dropped the memo decorator's benchmark log (437k/91.5%, the
  r4-audit grep rationale); lifted `_dedupe` from the three nested copies
  (solid/wsolid/dashed) into support (fixes its dangling reference); removed unused
  `Dict`/`Optional` imports.
- **builder delegation removed** — operators now import the LTL bricks directly from
  `aut2ltl.ltl.builders` (the project's LTL-over-spot layer) instead of through
  support's pass-through re-export; support keeps only the builders it uses; the facade
  sources the public LTL helpers from the bricks and drops unused internal re-exports.
- **reach.py** — dropped the guard's past-bug log line; aligned the docstring notation
  to the reference (`reach(S, B, β, T, τ)`).
- **wreach.py** — dropped the refactor-history parenthetical (named the removed
  `solid_w`/`dashed_w`).

## 2026-06-25 — operators code review complete (solid/wsolid/dashed; fin clean)

Finished the per-file comment pass over the operators package (all 7 files). Removed
progress-log / refactor-history / half-baked-instruction residue the sed carve carried
over: solid (the '2L breaker' from-S note, the stale `_stay_gt0` trace label, the
`p.11` page ref); wsolid (the 'Removed special stay_prop U path' history, stale
`Rws`/`Rws0` names, 'corrected paper', `p.12`, 2L-breaker); dashed (`p.13`, 2L-breaker
framing kept-the-illustration, the heisenbug/bare-except narration). reach/wreach/support
done earlier; fin.py reviewed clean. All comment-only here (no survey needed).

## 2026-06-25 — deep_nobls default + retranslate budget 1000; combinators/ regroup

LANDED (round trip / default). Shipped `deep_nobls` as `RECIPES["default"]` (was
`cakedsdet`) and raised the language retranslate budget 100 -> 1000
(`language.translate_tree_limit`, env `KR_TRANSLATE_TREE_LIMIT`). deep_nobls seeds
with cakedsdet, then runs a deep bottom-up `deep_roundtrip` re-presenting every DAG
node via the cascade-free `nobls` labeler (never-regress per node,
`best_of([identity, relabel(nobls)])`) + a final `hi` simplify — collapsing the buchi
towers from the leaves up. Sound throughout (0 FAIL). Size vs the prior default:
kinska DAG -94.9% (validated 89->99), benchmark -82.5% (255->266), genaut -97.5%
(745->750), validation -3.0%. The budget is a genuine tradeoff: on the genaut census
@1000 ~= @500 and costs ~12 verified answers vs @100 — pathological tiny automata
whose de-blobbing overruns the survey's 15s build budget and times out (blobs DOWN,
timeouts UP — different things). References refreshed
(results/reference/{validation,kinska,benchmark}, genaut/logs + frontier.pdf). Full
experiment log + reproducibility: research_notes/roundtrip_log.md. TODO: finer
per-Spot-call control (time+size bound each language.translate so a runaway
construction-translate declines one node instead of blowing the whole build).

LANDED (layout). Regrouped the five general-purpose combinator bricks
(first_success ⊕, best_of ⊞, compose ∘, recurse fix, memo) out of the cluttered
aut2ltl/ root into aut2ltl/combinators/ (first_success + compose promoted
module->package; facade __init__ re-exports the public surface as a one-stop index,
submodule paths still importable). Pure path-shift sweep across source + tests
(aut2ltl.<brick> -> aut2ltl.combinators.<brick>); validation gate unchanged (DAG=458,
80 TRUE). ltl_rewriter (floor contract), the roundtrip* re-presentation algorithms,
and the daisy* peels deliberately left in place. Each brick gains an algorithm.md +
the folder a README.

## 2026-06-25 — flushed from TODO (resolved/obsolete)

Carved resolved items out of TODO.md (prior text in git history):
- **best_of cost policy + wiring** — `significantly_smaller(rel, floor)` switch margin
  landed; `best_of` is wired as the default's choice combinator (cake/cakeds/cakedsdet/
  deep_nobls). [was "Refine best_of's cost policy, then wire it in"]
- **first_success -> peer package** — done by the combinators/ regroup (now
  aut2ltl/combinators/first_success/).
- **roundtrip_decomp test plan** — superseded: the round-trip family is validated via the
  surveys and deep_nobls (deep round trip) shipped as the default; roundtrip_decomp stays
  available under --use. [was the "NEXT" block]

Deleted as obsolete (no flush; git retains): the tests/benchmark/ "benchmark sub-project"
item (that tree is gone — benchmark lives in samples/benchmark + results/reference) and
the two stale bls probes (tests/bls/test_kr_zoom.py, measure_formula_dag.py — files
already removed).

## 2026-06-25 — STATUS.md reborn as an orientation map (prior snapshot flushed)

STATUS.md served long as the project snapshot, but its content had become duplicated by
the now-mature docs (root README, recipes/README, combinators/README, survey/README,
results/README, aut2ltl/README, bls/STATUS) and prone to rot — it carried stale numbers
(DAG=414, "373-case", "five recipes", best_of "unwired"), named the default, and listed a
gone tests/benchmark tree. Flushed: the prior What-works/default essay, combinator-algebra,
CLI, testing and layout sections live in those docs + git history. STATUS is rewritten in
its final form — a thin, non-rotting session-orientation map: the project works per the
root README; it is large (be guided to the part in play); don't read source unless asked;
the markdown orients; the four parts (aut2ltl/ survey/ results/ genaut/) each carry a
README. No numbers, no named default, nothing to drift.

## 2026-06-25 — ANALYSIS+DESIGN: Spot isolation / per-call timeouts (no code landed)

Design session for the top `TODO.md` item ("Finer per-Spot-call control: decouple
construction-translate from verify"). No code landed; the full design + implementation
plan + all context is captured in the UNTRACKED scratch `TODO_spot_isolation.md` at
repo root (deliberately not committed; this HISTORY entry is the durable why/when).

Problem: inside one survey build (~15s killable child), the `deep_nobls` default round
trip re-presents every DAG node bottom-up through `ltl2tgba`; one runaway translate eats
the whole build budget and kills a near-collapsed answer instead of declining that one
node. Today's guard is SIZE only (`language._guard_translation`), never time.

Governing facts established: (a) our scenarios reduce to two Spot ops — `ltl2tgba`
(formula->automaton, DANGEROUS) and `autfilt` (automaton ops, FINE in-process: our
automata are small); (b) the formula DAG is small but its FLATTENED form is horrible,
while automata are small (so HOA in/out is cheap); (c) an in-process timeout cannot
interrupt a Spot C++ call (GIL/deferred signal) so a real bound needs a child; runtime
is single-threaded; (d) reuse `survey/bounded.py` (coreutils `timeout` wrapper) +
`proc.py`, not new machinery — note `ltl2tgba` spawns no sub-children so bounded's
SIGINT->SIGKILL suffices, no extra proc.py wiring.

Decisions locked: isolate ONLY `ltl2tgba` (autfilt stays in-process); the SIZE guard
stays PRIMARY (decline over-budget formulas before any flatten — we do NOT OOM ourselves,
and a within-budget input that makes Spot OOM is Spot's limit, not ours); NO memory
limits in v1 (RLIMIT_AS is a noted extension, not now); trip (over-size OR wall-timeout OR
non-zero exit) -> raise `UntranslatableLanguage`, absorbed per-node by `best_of` at the
existing catch sites; two independent budget knobs (construction-translate vs equiv);
operation-aware semantic adapter (start one citizen, mediate more later via experiment);
placement = floor sibling `aut2ltl/spotrun/` (NOT inside `ltl/`), `_guard_translation`
relocates there; promote `survey/bounded.py` -> `aut2ltl/bounded.py` as a shared citizen;
no spotrun cache (sits below Language's interning memo).

A/B -> B: wrap the `ltl2tgba` CLI binary. "Serialization within time control" is honored
by the size guard: we flatten only AFTER the guard proves flat size <= budget, so the
string fed to ltl2tgba is small (~KB); the exponential translate runs in the killable
child under the wall-time budget. New knob `spotrun.translate_timeout` (~5s default,
env-read, < the 15s build budget). Migrates with the guard: KR_TRANSLATE_TREE_LIMIT
(1000), KR_TRANSLATE_TEMPORAL_LIMIT (32).

Rejected (recorded so it is not redone): in-process SIGALRM (cannot interrupt C++);
fork-from-main calling the `.translate()` binding (forks our big/stateful image —
bdd_dict/buddy + proc.py registry + fds); small broker-that-forks with an O(DAG) wire
format (elegant but more machinery — supervision/framing/reaping/restart — and its only
hard win is moot while the size guard keeps the flatten small; keep as a future backend
behind the same `spotrun.translate` API).

## 2026-06-25 — spotrun timeout: subprocess transport perturbs exploration order

C landed (killable per-call translate backend); switched the bounded child from the
ltl2tgba CLI to the binding (_child.py) + added an in-process fast path
(spotrun.inproc_tree_limit=100 / inproc_temporal_limit=16). Commit 6d73556d (WIP).

ROOT CAUSE of the kinska regression (counting_buchi_1ap_18: DAG 29 -> 225) found and
NOT yet fixed: crossing the process boundary (HOA serialize/parse, or reparse of
str(f)) returns an ISOMORPHIC automaton with PERMUTED STATE INDICES (verified iso,
e.g. sigma=(3 4)(7 8)). deep_roundtrip's reconstruction is NOT permutation-invariant,
so a permuted automaton blows up. In-process HOA round-trip -> 29 (fine); reparse ->
239 (bad): it is the exploration/visit order, not the backend or the bound. Per-node
the effect is invisible (good==perm identical); it is emergent in the cascade.

Lead: a canonical exploration-order heuristic (spot.canonicalize) before reconstruction
could make deep_roundtrip permutation-stable and the transport safe. Pure daisy
(--use nobls) declines the structured counting nodes; the per-node cost lives in the
daisystar-family peels. Debug instrumentation (KR_SPOTRUN_CMP/REPARSE/INPROC_RT) is
env-gated and TO BE REVERTED. See HANDOVER_spot_isolation.md.

## 2026-06-25 (cont.) — spotrun regression ROOT CAUSE corrected; instruments logged & dropped

The entry above blamed transport/state-permutation/exploration-order — DISPROVEN this
session. Confirmed cause against Spot 2.14.5 sources: `formula.translate()` is NOT
referentially transparent. Formula id is a process-global construction-order counter
(`fnode::next_id_`, formula.cc:1666-1688), `operator<` orders by it (formula.hh:790-808),
and the FM worklist is an id-ordered `std::set<formula>` (ltl2tgba_fm.cc:970,1912). So
translate depends on global formula-construction history: a `str(f)` reparse (what the
bounded child does) or a fresh process shifts the id-landscape -> a different, ~8x larger
automaton. In-proc `spot.formula(str(f)).translate()` reproduces the blow-up (DAG 239)
with NO subprocess; a fresh `bdd_dict` is inert -> the dict/permutation/HOA-interning
hypotheses are all ruled out. Full reasoning + experiment table: research_notes/spot_isolation.md.

DONE: kept the default (translate_timeout=3 + inproc barriers, backend active) — the
kinska size bump (counting_18 DAG 29->225) is a sound "ugly duck", validation stays
SUCCESS. WIRED state-index normalization `aut2ltl/ltl/canon.py` (used by Language.of +
_base) — defensive/free, but does NOT fix this regression (cause is upstream in translate).
The session's debug probes (KR_SPOTRUN_CMP/REPARSE/INPROC_RT/WARM/FRESHDICT + _debug_compare)
were committed once then dropped — recover from history if more debugging is needed.

## 2026-06-26 — deep_nobls_memo: memoize the no-bls assembly through one shared cache

WHY: deep_nobls (the default) re-peels shared buchi-tower suffixes on every descent
path — the no-bls return-labeler runs at ~DAG^2 cost, not DAG-size. New probe
tests/probes/gate_count.py (monkeypatches spot.are_equivalent, drives a recipe in-proc
on one HOA) quantified it on kinska counting_buchi_1ap_18: 1271 soundness-gate calls on
only 78 distinct (input, candidate) pairs = 94% exact recomputes, one suffix re-validated
240x. NB the gates themselves are cheap (~17ms of a 5.6s build): the cost is the
surrounding peel work (partition / build_leave / candidate translate / child delegation),
of which the gate is only the visible tip at the spot interface.

WHAT: recipe deep_nobls_memo (registered, NOT default — sibling for A/B; recipes are free
to keep). Inlines the nobls assembly and wraps every stage + the floor + the whole in a
SINGLE shared memo m keyed on the interned Language (= BDD/HOA identity): the
m(compose(m(a), m(b), ...)) shape. Sound by the combinator algebra (faithful-or-decline is
closed): any OK answer cached for a language is language-equivalent to what another stage
would produce, so the "dumb" stage-agnostic cache is never wrong (it can only over-decline,
never mis-answer). The daisy recursion leaf is the memoized daisy fixpoint; recurse is
untouched (knot hand-tied so the memo sits in it). WeakKeyDictionary, long-lived across
deep_roundtrip nodes; declines cached too.

RESULT (kinska counting_buchi_1ap_18): default backend 5.6s -> 4.0s, gates 1271 -> 195,
same DAG 225 / validation TRUE. Forced in-proc translate (KR_TRANSLATE_INPROC_*_LIMIT
high): 3.7s -> 2.1s, DAG 29 / TRUE. Two independent levers stack: memo kills the redundant
peel work, in-proc translate kills the subprocess fork cost (the bigger ~2x here). The
~195 gate floor is ~4 gates x 47 distinct sub-languages — each distinct language peeled
once; the residual "redundant" pairs are gates fired during a first-time (uncached) peel,
which a result-cache cannot dedup. On THIS input deep_nobls_memo does not beat a leaf-only
memo placement; kept the full shared-cache shape as the principled form. Adoption gate
(results/ corpora with --use deep_nobls_memo) run next.

## 2026-06-26 — sorted peel recipes, inv no-op pruning, language cache, diff rewrite

LANDED. A session sparked by "try precise methods before heuristics" in the daisy
family.

- **peel / peel_decomp (portfolio/builder.py).** New sorted-peel combinators that
  order the EXACT producers ahead of the gated heuristics: per descent Daisy ->
  DaisystarDet (rejecting deterministic SCC) -> PartScc (accepting terminal SCC, now
  PROMOTED out of the core floor) -> Daisy2 -> Daisystar -> floor. `peel(floor)` is
  the plain peel; `peel_decomp(floor)` weaves inv->strength->acc->scc into every
  descent. `decline` (the first_success unit) is the no-cascade floor; peel(bls) the
  always-answers floor. Both are decorators taking the floor.
- **deep_nobls_sort{,_decomp} recipes.** deep_nobls' two-engine deep_roundtrip over
  the sorted peel: forward peel(bls) seed, return peel(decline) labeler (bls is
  counterproductive on the return path). Registered; default pointer unchanged.
  Sound on validation/benchmark/kinska/genaut (0 FAIL/CLASH). The _decomp variant
  matches the default's coverage at a small size win; the plain variant regresses
  coverage by 2 (needs the recursive decomp). KR_TRANSLATE_INPROC_TEMPORAL_LIMIT=0
  counters the kinska size growth decisively (kinska DAG -87% vs limit-on) at the
  cost of ~10 counting-automaton timeouts + ~2x build.
- **inv no-op pruning (decomp/inv/invariant.py).** When Sigma != true but the
  Coudert-Madre strip leaves the automaton unchanged, child.formula already entails
  G(Sigma), so re-asserting it is pure bloat. Detect by Language identity (the
  stripped automaton interns to the SAME object as the input) and pass through with
  no inv credit, like the vacuous case. strip.py untouched. Does NOT cover
  obligation.ltl:5 (its strip genuinely loosens guards, so its G is non-redundant
  relative to the residual — left as-is: DAG size is a poor readability proxy, a
  best_of guard rejected as too expensive).
- **language intern LRU 512 -> 10000 (language.py).** 512 evicted/rebuilt languages
  mid-run, defeating identity-keyed sharing (inv no-op test, deep_nobls_memo memo).
- **survey.diff.results rewrite.** Was conflating "answered" with the LTL count,
  hiding NOT_LTL and no-answer (the misread that started this). Now mirrors
  report.summarize (resolved LTL/not-LTL, no-answer, validated over LTL only), adds
  Sigma build_s runtime, a left->right technique-SHIFT diff, tail-anchored source
  keys, compact --top default 3, opt-in --formulas.

## 2026-06-30 — federated translator trace + brick reification

Built a federated, human-browsable trace facility to investigate the in-proc vs
out-of-proc translate divergence (untracked note `tracing_spot_inproc.md`).

- **`aut2ltl/printer.py`** (new): `format_language(lang, aut)` (the pulled twa: id /
  states / edges / ap / acc / det, HOA dump to `AUT2LTL_TRACE_DIR` at full verbosity)
  and `format_result(res)` (status / technique / gated formula / dag·temporal·tree·
  sharing). Pure builders, called only under each translator's `if _TRACE:` guard —
  no trace string (no flatten) computed when off. Verbosity is the printer's own knob
  `AUT2LTL_TRACE_VERBOSITY` (stats|full), separate from the on/off gate.
- **One federated gate `TRANSLATOR_TRACE_ON`** (presence-based, isdef — not a parsed
  value), OR-ed into every component's local `*_TRACE`. `_trace()` helper retired for
  inlined `if _TRACE:` guards (so the compute, not just the print, is skipped). TODO
  added to do the same for `bls/operators/`.
- **`Language.id`**: short fingerprint of the intern key, stamped by `of`/`of_ltl`;
  never triggers a build. (An experiment keying it on the normalized base automaton
  was tried and reverted — a print must reflect identity, not deform it to hide that
  two equivalent formulas are distinct objects.)
- **Instrumented**: daisy / daisy2 / daisystar / daisystardet (in/gate/out + each
  exit `delegating ... as language`), the `decompose` combinator (split + per-operand
  dispatch, one flag for strength/acc/scc), `deep_roundtrip`, `partscc`, `inv`,
  `first_success` (choice ladder), `best_of` (in/out + size choice), `relabel` (the
  formula→Language crossing — the source of a re-presented automaton).
- **Reification (Option 1, named functors — no ABC/inheritance)**: the closure
  factories `identity` / `relabel` / `as_translator` / `deep_roundtrip` / `recurse`
  became functor classes carrying `.name`, so every brick names itself and the trace
  stops printing `function`. Factories preserved; the `decompose` fixpoint is named by
  its tag.
- **`Language` representations** (`tgba` / `det_parity_sbacc` / `det_generic` /
  `det_generic_minimal`) now run through `canon.normalize` after postprocess —
  determinism first, so the twa a translator pulls carries the canonical numbering,
  not just the base. Validation gate SUCCESS, diff vs reference clean (DAG/tree
  unchanged).

Finding: forcing canonical numbering did NOT collapse the term030 A/B divergence —
the two backends produce structurally distinct (not merely differently-numbered)
automata at the relevant sub-language; both sound. The trace now localizes the
divergence to the `deep_nobls_arm` `identity` node (`a | (GF!b…)` vs `a | X(GF!b…)`)
and the `relabel` crossing that translates each to an equivalent automaton.

## 2026-06-30 — EU class rules (pass 5) + context-pass soundness fix

LANDED. Two things in the ltl/simplify package this session.

(1) New pass 5: `spot_EU_rules.py` (`eu_simplify`) — Spot's always-applied (≡)
eventual/universal absorptions keyed on the cached `is_eventual`/`is_universal`
node bits (F e≡e, G u≡u, X q≡q, f U e≡e, f R u≡u, u W g≡u∨g, e M g≡e∧g, and the
suspendable X-rotations). Reads the bits straight off the hash-consed DAG — no
BDD/automata — one memoised bottom-up walk, strictly O(DAG); monotone (no ≡
inverse) so it can't ping-pong. Disjoint from rules 1-4: 14/16 fire-cases are
left untouched by the existing pipeline. Wired into `simplify` after context and
again after fold, gated by KR_SIMP_OWN_EU (default on). Catalogue (incl. the
deferred n-ary / size-increasing rules that overlap fold's GF/FG cofactoring) in
`algorithm_EU_rules.md`. Probe: tests/probes/ltl/simplify/test_eu_rules.py (22).
Why/when: investigating whether Spot's EU rules buy us anything own-simplify
lacks. Note for the record: Spot's `tl_simplifier::simplify` IS node-memoised
(O(#DAG nodes) recursion) but NOT O(DAG)-complexity — boolean→BDD→ISOP,
containment DNF/CNF, and regrouping rebuilds materialise off-DAG nodes; the X
drop on `X(GF!b & F(...))` needs `-r3` containment (semantic, PSPACE), not the
syntactic class rules, because the OR hides the FG tail from the class bits.

(2) Soundness fix in `context_pass.py`. The And/Or context pass rewrote each
child against the ORIGINAL form of all siblings (single snapshot) then replaced
each sibling with its rewritten form, so two siblings could discharge each other:
`a & b & (a M b) -> a` (atom b reduces (a M b) to ⊤ via now-eval while (a M b)'s
opening erases that same b), dually `!a | !b | (!a W !b) -> !a`. Both sides,
R/M and U/W alike (NOT an R/M adaptation failure — the U/W path had the identical
latent defect; the old `!(b R (Gb & (b M Gb))) -> 0` witness is the same). Fixed
by sequential conditional simplification: assume each sibling in the form it
actually has at that step — finalized for already-processed siblings, original
for the rest, openings only from finalized earlier siblings — so a sibling
reduced to a constant contributes nothing and the cycle breaks. Single pass,
order-sensitive (sound for any fixed order), still O(DAG); valuable openings
survive when the opener stands (`b & (a M b) -> a M b`). random_equiv unchanged
(21.9% smaller, ALL EQUIVALENT). Regression guards added to test_now_eval.py.
The LTL now-eval forms credited to ITS-Tools (Bonneland = CTL core).

## 2026-06-30 — non-LTL witness cabled in as a checked, surveyed result

LANDED. The NOT_LTL witness was decorative: the front end printed it as non-ASCII
prose on stderr (`Witness.summary()`), nothing parsed it, and the survey recorded
NOT_LTL rows with an empty `validation` cell — ~64 verdicts never checked ("a false
negative passes silently", `nonltl.md`). This increment makes the witness a
first-class, machine-readable, *replayed* result.

Pieces (one feature, walked file by file):
- `aut2ltl/witness.py` — `serialize()`/`parse()` round-trip; a bare one-line payload
  in Spot word syntax (`p=3 u=[] v=[a; a] x=[cycle{!a}]`); ASCII `summary()`.
- `aut2ltl/verifier/` — NEW root package promoted out of `tests/probes/verifier/`:
  membership-only checker (Spot lasso intersection, acceptance-agnostic), API
  `verify(aut, Witness) -> (ok, pattern)` + CLI (`VERIFY: ok/fail/no-witness`, exit
  0/1/2), README + algorithm.md. Floor-level (imports only Witness + Spot). It is the
  *suggestive* tier (corroborates; a fail is a real bad-certificate flag).
- `aut2ltl/__main__.py` — stdout is now KIND-TAGGED, homogeneous: `LTL: <formula>` /
  `NOT_LTL: <witness>` (Option B, chosen over the bare-formula filter — ltlfilt is a
  no-op on our massaged output; a bare/pipe mode may be retrofitted, see TODO). `--dag`
  and `-o` stay bare. stderr ASCII.
- `survey/{build,verify,run,report}.py` — capture + strip the tag, replay the witness
  via the verifier in a bounded subprocess, fill `validation` in the SAME
  TRUE/FAIL/TIMEOUT/ERROR vocabulary as the LTL oracle. Incomplete / non-toggling
  family ⇒ FAIL, which trips the hard run gate (soundness) like a non-equivalent
  formula. New `check_s` column (verify wall time, both paths); witness carried in the
  `formula` cell as a re-checkable certificate.

Decisions: stdout tagged (not bare); ASCII only (no `—·ⁿωε`); validation mirrors the
LTL vocabulary exactly, no witness-specific tokens — an uncertified NOT_LTL is FAIL,
on purpose (it lights up the corpus as the goal to fix).

Verified: verifier spec green; validation gate SUCCESS (81 TRUE); mod3 row clean
(`validation=TRUE, check_s≈0.055`). Kinska scan (the payoff): 99 LTL/TRUE,
54 NOT_LTL/TRUE, 9 NOT_LTL/FAIL, 3 TIMEOUT — survey goes FAIL. The 9 FAILs cluster in
`samples/kinska/counting/2ap/` (`counting_buchi_2ap_{05,07,08,09,10,20,21,22,23}`).

Also: the front-page mod3 example was `autfilt --small`'d (5→4 states, complement
sink removed; equivalent, identical witness) and `docs/img/mod3_a.png` regenerated.

OPEN (step 2): the counting/2ap FAILs are witnesses that arrive incomplete through
PEELING — the witness must travel up the translator chain and be completed there — or
genuine spurious groups ⇒ abstain. Reference CSV regeneration (NOT_LTL rows now carry
`validation` + `check_s`; check `survey.diff.results` for the new column) is a separate
step. README/IO refresh held until stable (TODO).

## 2026-07-01 — Peelers lift the non-LTL witness across their peel

The non-LTL witness was emitted anchored at the NOT_LTL *core*, but a peeling
translator reaches that core only after consuming a prefix off its input, so the
witness `u` started in the wrong place — replayed against the source it produced the
`1 0 0 0 …` non-toggle and the survey verifier marked it FAIL (the kinska `counting/2ap`
cluster, 9 rows).

Fix: the witness now **travels up the peel**. New result-algebra move
`LTLResult.prefix(precursor, word, *techniques)` — the peeler's variant of `credit`:
it lifts a NOT_LTL child's witness by prepending the consumed prefix to the anchor `u`
(`Witness.prepend`, Spot word syntax; `v`/`x` untouched — a peel re-roots, it does not
relabel), folds the child in, and stamps the peeler's own technique, in one call.
`credit` now also unions techniques on its NOK branch, so provenance accumulates up a
NOT_LTL path. `__main__` prints a `technique :` line on the NOT_LTL branch (it only did
so on the OK branch), so the survey records which peeler produced the verdict.

Wired into two peelers: `daisy` prepends the single stem guard `g` (`w[u ↦ g·u]`);
`daisystardet` prepends a reaching word through the rejecting SCC ending in the exit
guard (new `shape.exit_word`, a BFS `h ⟶* p →(g) dst`). After this the whole
`counting/2ap` cluster validates TRUE (kinska 153→162 TRUE, 9→0 FAIL; validation gate
still SUCCESS, DAG unchanged — the lift touches only NOT_LTL rows, which carry no
formula). Each algorithm.md gained the three-valued `Label = Some φ | NotLTL(w) | ⊥` and
the formal lift. Two regression fixtures grafting a reachable prefix onto the counting
core: `prefix_nonltl_1.hoa` (daisystardet, spoke exit, TRUE) and `prefix_nonltl_2.hoa`
(initial-state exit, currently routed to the not-yet-lifted `daisy2`, red-by-design),
both in `samples/validation/hoa` and `samples/benchmark/inputs/core`. Next peeler:
`daisy2`.

## 2026-07-01 — daisy2 joins the lifted peelers

daisy2's stems are hub exits (`shape.star_partition` collects them from `aut.out(h)`; a
spoke edge to a third state declines the peel), so the reaching word is a single stem
guard and the lift is daisy's, one line: `res.prefix(child, str(g), _NAME)`. The grafted
`prefix_nonltl_2.hoa` (initial-state exit) now routes daisy2 → NOT_LTL → witness
`u=[!c] …` and validates TRUE. algorithm.md gains the non-LTL stem child + guard lift.
Three peelers now carry the lift (daisy, daisy2, daisystardet); no other peeler has been
observed emitting a NOT_LTL witness yet.

## 2026-07-01 — Memo op-cache + genaut reference refresh (consolidation, no breakthrough)

WHY/WHAT landed this session:

- **Memo brick keyed on `(operation, Language)` + shareable store** (`combinators/memo`,
  commit 297b6d7c). Cache gains an op dimension (`id(child)`) and an optional shared
  `store` (`Memo.new_store()`), a two-level `WeakKeyDictionary[Language, {op-id: result}]`.
  One shared store now holds many operations as a BDD-style compute table where distinct
  ops never shadow one another on a language. Default store stays per-instance, so
  `roundtrip_best`'s single-`Memo` use is unchanged. Docs (README/algorithm/__init__)
  updated to match. Motivation: the earlier language-only shared cache made the first
  stage to resolve a language an undisplaceable "king" and could not memoize the
  simplifier without shadowing.

- **`deep_nobls_memo` puts every arm op on one shared store** (commit 2deaab3e). Threads
  one store through the inlined `nobls` arm (each peel primitive, floor, decomp stage,
  daisy fixpoint, whole, simplifier) plus the seed and final simplify. Output-neutral vs
  `deep_nobls` on all three corpora — but PERF-FLAT (build ±2%). Root cause diagnosed:
  the `cakedsdet` seed is only top-level memoized (called once by `as_translator` → the
  entry is never reused); its bls/r3 internals are on no shared store and cannot share
  with the arm. TODO added (commit ecf6707b) to instrument the memo and inline+depth-wrap
  the seed. Full plan handed off in the untracked root `memo.md`.

- **Null results (recorded, not landed):** the "super-memo" (every primitive on one
  store) is perf-flat on validation/kinska/benchmark; the spotrun-limit boost
  (`KR_TRANSLATE_INPROC_TREE_LIMIT=300`, `KR_TRANSLATE_TREE_LIMIT=3000`, timeout 3s) was a
  clean no-op on all three corpora — the buchi towers did not collapse at 3k. Scratch in
  `logs/opcache2/`, `logs/spotboost/`.

- **genaut reference runs refreshed for all ≤1k shapes** (commits earlier 2state1ap1acc,
  then 9d133379 for the set). `2state1ap1acc` (929) lands the recent size wins
  (DAG 5432→4383, −19%; 750→759 LTL; 57→48 timeout) and, crucially, exercises the NEW
  NOT_LTL witness validation for the first time: 76 witness TRUE / **46 witness FAIL**.
  The 46 are witness-validation failures (a check the old reference never ran), NOT LTL
  non-equivalence — the LTL side is clean (758/758 verified). This is the known-open
  witness soundness gap (`nonltl.md` / TODO: completed-witness gating + `_distinguish`
  widening ⇒ abstain, not reject); the shape is a strong regression fixture for it.

## 2026-07-01 — non-LTL soundness, phase 3 opened (fixtures + probes)

- LANDED: `samples/fixtures/hoa/various/gf_aa_parity.hoa` — run-parity sibling of
  `gf_aa.hoa` (same language `GF(a & Xa)`, Z2 in the transition monoid). FOUND:
  `label_ltl_definable` reads it `(definable=False, conclusive=True)` on the real
  `det_generic_minimal()` path — a live conclusive false reject, hidden in the default
  recipe only by `first_success` arm ordering (daisy2 answers before any gated rung).
- LANDED: `samples/fixtures/hoa/various/evenblocks_nonltl.hoa` — prefix-independent,
  genuinely non-LTL. FOUND: the default run emits a complete FALSE witness
  (`p=2 u=[] v=[a] x=[cycle{!a}]`, technique acc2+daisystar; `VERIFY: fail`), and no
  linear family can ever witness a prefix-independent language — the omega-power shape
  `u.(v^n.y)^w` is required (Arnold's two context shapes ⇒ the pair is complete).
- LANDED: `tests/probes/omega_power_family.py` (both family-shape membership patterns),
  `tests/probes/det_generic_form.py` (the tester's actual input form + verdict).
- Findings, theory (quotient argument invalid — positive direction stands via Thomas;
  minimization not decisive; linear-shape blindness) and the fix list: root
  `witness3.md` (scratch). Session logs: `logs/nonltl_fixtures/`.

## 2026-07-01 — definability fail-safe + both witness shapes (phase-3 fixes 1-3)

- LANDED (docs first, per procedure): overhauled `tester/algorithm.md`,
  `witness/algorithm.md`, `definability/README.md` — the one-sided soundness
  argument (Thomas 1979 replaces the invalid quotient sketch), the three-outcome
  gate contract, the two family shapes with joint completeness (Arnold) and the
  prefix-independence blindness lemma.
- LANDED: fail-safe gate (`gate.py`) — absorbing NOT_LTL only on a witness
  certified by in-process replay; uncertified suspicion = non-absorbing
  PROBABLY_NOT_LTL decline, inner fenced; oracle-could-not-run (`definable=None`,
  tester+language) takes the same fence with its own reason. Kills the live
  false reject on gf_aa_parity (GF(a & Xa) run-parity form; validation SUCCESS
  83/83 TRUE, 0 regressions, NOT_LTL rows gain the 'gate' technique tag).
- LANDED: exhaustive linear completion (`witness/linear.py` — all closed cycles
  >= 2 x all phase pairs, pattern read-back period) and the omega-power shape
  end-to-end (`witness/{enriched,omega}.py`, `Witness.y`, `verifier.verify_omega`,
  serialization `y=[...]`). Payoff: evenblocks_nonltl certifies at the top gate
  (p=2 u=[] v=[a] y=[a; !a], VERIFY ok 01010) where the linear shape is provably
  blind; gf_aa_parity declines after exhausting BOTH shapes.
- Fixtures grouped under `samples/fixtures/hoa/definability/` (+ gf_aa, sixap).
- OPEN (fix 4): a child gate's certified verdict crosses decomposers
  unrevalidated (`credit` keeps the first witness; acc2 intersection propagation
  unsound in principle) — evenblocks default run still surfaces the child's stale
  linear family over the top gate's correct omega-power one. Plan: root
  `witness3.md`.

## 2026-07-02 — fix 4: NOT_LTL boundary revalidation (phase 3 continued)

- LANDED (docs first): the NOT_LTL crossing law in decompose/algorithm.md and the
  exactness/revalidation notes in the three daisy-family algorithm.md; the verifier
  gains `revalidated(result, lang)` (membership-only boundary filter, no GAP) wired
  at the decompose combine and the three prefix() lift sites.
- Effect: the evenblocks false certificate (an acc2 child family certified for the
  child, false for the intersection) now degrades to an honest DECLINED under the
  deep recipe; prefix_nonltl_{1,2} and mod3_a keep their certified lifted verdicts;
  validation SUCCESS 83/83 TRUE.
- Also: TODO/STATUS refreshed (the phase-2 soundness item is closed; the remaining
  fronts — seam refinements (parts-algebra revalidation, daisy petal-drop), parent
  completion seeded by the child v (no GAP), cascade self-fence, counter-free
  sibling search — are the new Open block). The 2026-07-01 genaut 2state1ap1acc
  background rerun mixed two code states (edits landed mid-run) and was discarded.

## 2026-07-02 — plan item 1: local exact lifts + parts-algebra revalidation

- LANDED: the daisy petal-drop (restricted guard g ∧ ¬σ ∧ ⋀¬g_other-target,
  BDD-only — an exact left quotient makes the lift sound with NO replay; empty →
  degrade) and the daisystardet exact reaching word (per-step restriction in
  shape.exit_word, Optional — the deterministic L-partition covers in-C overlaps,
  the restriction closes exits-en-route). daisy2 keeps the replay filter (it is a
  heuristic — per user, no further investment).
- LANDED: decompose revalidates through the PARTS (verifier.revalidated_by_parts
  over verify_with/samples): membership of any word in the host is the connective
  of part memberships (faithfulness), so the crossing filter never builds a
  parent-sized product. Connective identified by the empty fold (And([]) = tt).
- Battery: prefix_nonltl_1 (exact reaching word) and _2 (daisy2 replay) keep their
  certified lifted witnesses; mod3_a / gf_aa_parity unchanged; evenblocks stays the
  honest DECLINED (recovery = parent completion seeded by the child v, TODO).
  Validation SUCCESS 83/83 TRUE.

## 2026-07-02 — plan item 2: the reseed recovery (evenblocks certified end-to-end)

- LANDED (docs first): witness/algorithm.md "Reseeding a crossed verdict" +
  decompose/algorithm.md crossing recovery step; `witness/reseed.py`
  (re-express the crossed v over the host's det form, run linear-then-omega-power
  completion — no GAP); `revalidated_by_parts(..., host, reseed)` hook (verifier
  stays engine-free, the callable injected); wired in acceptance/scc/strength.
- Payoff: evenblocks_nonltl is again a CERTIFIED NOT_LTL end-to-end
  (p=2 u=[] v=[a] y=[a; !a], reseeded at the acc2 crossing, replayed through the
  split parts; single clean diagnosis). prefix_nonltl_{1,2}, mod3_a, gf_aa_parity
  unchanged. Full validation survey on this exact state deferred to next session
  (fixture battery green; the previous two states each passed 83/83 TRUE).

## 2026-07-02 — the anchor algorithm: designed, documented, implemented, wired

Session outcome: a new exact translator, `aut2ltl/anchor`, fusing `partscc`
(terminal input-deterministic SCC) and `daisystardet` (rejecting exiting one)
into ONE equation `Final = STAY∞ ∨ LEAVE` and strictly extending them: the
input-determinism precondition weakens to ANCHORED recoverability (P1 anchors
partition, P2 loop letters fake no foreign anchor), so shared idle letters on
self-loops — the response-formula shape, `G(a→Fb)` — stop killing the read-off.
Phase = target of the last anchor; stretches compressed by W/U; fairness
restructured around parking via `F_all` (only states carrying every color get a
park term). Rejecting/terminal/accepting-with-exits/singleton all fall out as
degeneracies, no dispatch, no equivalence gate (exact by construction).

- DOCS-FIRST: `aut2ltl/anchor/algorithm.md` written and reviewed over three
  rounds (standalone presentation, L/A/M/E labels, three-layer construction:
  loop-free+exit-free → relax E → relax L; q0 anchoring motivated; F_all with
  the construction-time `[q0 ∈ F_all]` guard). Fixture set
  `samples/fixtures/hoa/anchor/` (gafb_response.hoa, the motivator: anchored
  but NOT input-deterministic).
- CODE: `anchor/{shape,formula,lift,anchor}.py` (+ probe
  `tests/probes/anchor_probe.py`, child = the self-fixpoint Λ = Anchor(Λ)).
  Spot-verified equivalent on gafb, t2 l3/l6, fairness_example,
  collapse_example; mod3_a correctly declines on P1.
- RECIPES: `deep_memo` (the deep_nobls_memo TODO wiring gap FIXED: cakedsdet
  seed inlined and depth-wrapped on the ONE store; rich arm ≡ nobls so the
  seed's rich arm and the deep arm are one shared instance — measurement still
  open) and `deep_anchor` (the A/B copy: Daisy → Simplify(Anchor,hi) → Daisy2
  → Daisystar, PartScc floors gone, incumbent floors on bare bls). Validation
  gate SUCCESS (83 TRUE). Apples-to-apples on gafb: anchor 17 tree nodes/9ms
  vs bls 26/1.04s; daisy2's gated form is smaller (6) — ordering data for the
  A/B, plus first own-rule candidate F(p ∧ X(p U q)) ≡ F(p ∧ Xq) (TODO'd).
- Fairness trichotomy is irredundant in general (separating words per term);
  BDD-checkable drop condition noted: park(s) is subsumed by the GF term when
  L(s) ⊆ A(s) (every loop letter of s also anchors s).
- NEXT: A/B deep_memo vs deep_anchor on the corpora; memo hit-rate
  measurement; own-simplify rules; then retire `partscc/` + `daisystardet/`.

## 2026-07-02 — anchor finishing touches 1+2 (park drop, slide-to-last)

LANDED: the two mechanical items from the anchor handoff (anchor_next.md).
(1) Park-subsumption drop in anchor/formula.py (build-time BDD test
L(s) & !A(s) == false on F_all states; skips F park(s) and G L(q0));
documented in anchor/algorithm.md; new fixture park_drop.hoa where it
fires (fair = bare GF(a & b)). Gates: all anchor probes green, mod3_a
still declines, gafb output byte-identical, validation gate SUCCESS
(83 TRUE, log tests/probes/logs/validation_after_park_drop.log).
(2) Slide-to-last in simplify/fold_pass.py, generalized past the handoff
form to r U (h & X(p U q)) -> r U (h & Xq) when p |= h |= r, plus the
release-head dual (spec'd in simplify/algorithm.md, user-adopted).
Suite test_slide_last.py 14/14; fold regression 42/42; fuzz clean.
Acceptance met: collapse_example --use deep_anchor now F(b & X!a).
Also fixed simplify/README stale test paths (tests/probes/ltl/simplify/).

## 2026-07-02 — the k-anchor session (design -> algorithm.md -> graded brick)

LANDED: aut2ltl/kanchor/, the graded anchored read-off, built doc-first
from the anchor_next.md handoff (finishing touches logged above).
Design settled in discussion: windows over ADJACENT letters with I(v)
as the stutter abstraction (the last-k-anchors trap avoided); the start
handled by 0-step anchors only (P0^2 = the partition test of the
truncated windows rooted at q0); two elements derived beyond the
handoff sketch and adopted -- the 0-step park disjunct (a run moving at
position 0 and parking immediately is invisible to pair-park and GF)
and the spurious-trigger corollary (the eager per-edge law is the only
law LTL can state; P1^2/P2^2 are its license). Then the unification:
truncated windows vanish at k=1, so anchor IS the construction at k=1
-- one brick, no orchestration.
Code: peer working copy of anchor/ (frozen for the clone period);
formula.py split orthogonally into pieces.py (letter vocabulary, +
sojourn-tautology collapse L|M=T => sojourn=T, disable-able) and
label.py (level-agnostic assembler over TriggerEntry(trigger, offset,
target) tables); windows.py owns the graded tests and table builders --
the Sigma x Sigma relations never materialize (rectangle decomposition
for P1^2/P2^2, exact recursive rectangle cover for Stay_k <= Enter_k,
no doubled BDD variables); kanchor.py runs the k-ladder with graded
decline diagnoses.
Gates: kanchor_rail.py demands hash-consed identity of KAnchor
(collapse=False) vs Anchor at k=1 -- byte-identical on all five anchor
fixtures, mod3_a declines at both levels; new fixture gf_a_xa.hoa reads
off EXACTLY GF(a & Xa) at k=2 (the worked example reproduced, no
simplifier); with the collapse live gafb reduces to its bare fairness
(the law was tautological -- total automaton) and t2_l3 to a single G
clause, all spot-verified.
Doc: kanchor/algorithm.md rewritten standalone (algorithm_k1.md copy
absorbed and retired): twelve numbered layers, one relaxation each,
k=1 fully developed before the window widens; two worked examples;
exactness stated once for every level. User-reviewed, pushed.
Open: STATUS/TODO do not yet mention kanchor; anchor/ frozen (bugfix-
only, mirrored) until the subsume/retire decision; measurement and the
recipe question deferred to a weaker-LLM session.

## 2026-07-02 — the exact definability oracle (bls/definability/oracle/)

DONE. Designed and landed the syntactic-ω-semigroup oracle: LTL-definability
decided EXACTLY, both directions theorems, INCONCLUSIVE = resource caps only.
The design session first produced `oracle/algorithm.md` (iterated standalone,
procedure-first), whose key mathematics emerged while examining the algorithm
symbolically: the COLLAPSE LEMMA — Acc(prefix, cycle) sees the prefix only
through one state, so Arnold's congruence factors into ~lin (pointwise residual
equality of state parts, a QxQ relation computed once on D) and ~w (a RIGHT
congruence refinement seeded by a |Q|-bit acceptance profile); left translations
vanish, and the factoring names the witness shape (~lin split -> F1 linear via a
residual-product separator; ~w split -> F2 omega-power, pattern read off the
profile table). Implementation: eight single-role modules (closure / residuals /
profile / refine / quotient / family / oracle / __init__) + one-input probe.
Validated: gf_aa_parity -> definitive LTL via the quotient (the former
PROBABLY_NOT_LTL abstain class — TODO Route B superseded, no SAT search);
mod3_a -> NOT_LTL p=3 linear (shorter v than the GAP-seeded path); evenblocks ->
NOT_LTL p=2 omega-power; both prefix_nonltl -> NOT_LTL p=2; all ~0.5s. GAP is
now optional on the oracle path (screen skipped if unrunnable; quotient decides).
NOT wIRED into the gate yet (TODO). Prospective: symbolic EM via libITS (slots
are right-slot-local; the one hard op is self-application for profiles).

## 2026-07-02 — oracle/algorithm.md matured: layers, spot primitive, external review

DONE, same session as the oracle landing. (1) algorithm.md rewritten in the
kanchor presentation style: 14 numbered layers, worked examples carrying the
REAL pipeline numbers via the new tests/probes/oracle_dump.py (mod3 |EM1|=15
quotient 9 empty chase; gf_aa_parity 10 elements fold to 6 classes aperiodic;
evenblocks 1 residual class == the blindness lemma as data, chase discovers
b=[!a]). (2) residuals.py now delegates the eager state equivalence to
spot.language_map (twaalgos/langmap.hh — the exact primitive: dualized
complement cached per state, on-the-fly intersects; our HOA-roundtrip
hand-rolled version retired); verdicts and witnesses identical on all four
decisive fixtures. (3) Integrated an end-to-end review by a second Fable: the
screen is now justified INTERNALLY (aperiodicity inherited upward through the
enrichment — e^n = (f^n, monotone bounded marks) — Thomas 1979 demoted to a
historical remark, both LTL paths bottom out on Perrin); layer 2 completeness
named the keystone citation; layer 7 unfolds the sample words in place; intro
states assumed background. Literature review deferred: root oracle_litt.md is
the standalone prompt for the search-enabled sweep (Buchi-1962 root of the
enrichment, explicit-SOSG prior art, Preugschat-Wilke, FDFA/right-congruence
adjacency, omega PSPACE citation, tool landscape, certificate prior art).

## 2026-07-03 — literature round P2 lands; algorithm.md/related_work.md split

Paper round P2 (ABF 2018, AF 2021, Cho–Huynh, McConnell, Fogarty–Vardi)
read first-hand and integrated into research_notes/definability.md (its
first commit — rounds 1–3 and P1 land with it). Outcome folded into the
oracle docs under a concern split settled with the user: algorithm.md
stays in-source spec register and cites only what roots a definition or a
soundness argument — it gains the layer-5 rotation lemma (the conjugacy
step licensing right-only computation of a two-sided congruence, until now
chased silently), the ~lin naming (Maler–Staiger 1997), and the
PSPACE-completeness anchor for the caps; everything positioning-flavored
moved to the new companion oracle/related_work.md, the paper-voice digest
(eight sections, each neighbor with "why cited"). Sole reviewer-sourced
item left: AF14's syntactic-FDFA definition, fetch pending.

2026-07-03 — kanchor: the identifiability promotion LANDED. A loop letter whose
every in-C occurrence is at s (disjoint from every other state's L and A) is
promoted at build time out of L[s] into A[s] (trigger side) and M[s] (a unit
re-entry is a legal stay-ender); L[s] keeps only the necessary stay letters.
Stated as definition in kanchor/algorithm.md layer 4 (+ the 4.1 degeneration:
disjoint full inputs => L = 0 => the one-step law; the P2 diagonal exemption
mostly moot), implemented in shape.py lame_data. collapse=False no longer
claims byte-identity to aut2ltl/anchor (kanchor.py/pieces.py doc scrub) — the
kanchor_rail probe's premise is broken by design, its fate TBD. Validation:
--use kanchor run SUCCESS, diff vs committed reference 0 regressions, kanchor
takes over the partscc/daisystardet rows at DAG +0.0% (458->458, tree 584),
build -16%.

2026-07-03 — aut2ltl/anchor RETIRED (with a warm salute). It was the stage to
kanchor: kanchor/algorithm.md had absorbed its reference and the k = 1 level
subsumes its construction. Removed the package, recipes/deep_anchor.py and its
registry entries, tests/probes/anchor_probe.py (kanchor_probe.py does the job)
and kanchor_rail.py (its byte-identity premise died with the promotion);
scrubbed the dangling references (kanchor prose, TODO own-simplify item,
fixtures README — the samples/fixtures/hoa/anchor/ automata stay, exercising
kanchor). Validation gate after retirement: SUCCESS, diff vs reference 0
regressions, DAG +0.0%.

2026-07-03 — archived: root anchor_next.md (untracked development notes on
anchor/kanchor, written 2026-07-02), reproduced verbatim below. All of it
landed and was superseded by aut2ltl/kanchor (anchor itself retired today),
except the partscc/daisystardet retirement, which remains tracked in TODO.md.

# anchor — handoff (untracked): where to go next

Bootstrap for a session on the `anchor` algorithm. Read in this order:
`STATUS.md` → `aut2ltl/anchor/algorithm.md` (THE reference — the algorithm, its
notation L/A/M/E, preconditions P1/P2, the label, exactness) → this note. Do not
read `docs/HISTORY.md`. Sanity-run before changing anything:

    timeout 15 python3 tests/probes/anchor_probe.py samples/fixtures/hoa/anchor/gafb_response.hoa

expect `status=OK` and `VERIFY: ok`.

## What exists (2026-07-02)

- `aut2ltl/anchor/` — `algorithm.md` (reviewed, authoritative), `shape.py`
  (L/A/M/E split + `anchored_violation` P1/P2 test), `formula.py`
  (`build_final`: sojourn/step/park/F_all-fairness/leave → `STAY∞ ∨ LEAVE`),
  `lift.py` (`exit_word`, the NOT_LTL witness lift), `anchor.py` (the
  Translator; trace env `ANCHOR_TRACE`). Exact by construction; NO equivalence
  gate — do not add one.
- Fixtures `samples/fixtures/hoa/anchor/`; probe `tests/probes/anchor_probe.py`
  (ONE HOA per invocation, self-fixpoint child, spot-verifies OK labels).
  Verified: gafb_response, t2_successes_l3/l6, fairness_example,
  collapse_example; mod3_a correctly DECLINES on P1.
- Recipes (`--use <name>`, registered, default unchanged):
  `deep_memo` = deep_nobls_memo finished (whole pipeline inlined on ONE Memo
  store; the rich arm ≡ nobls is ONE instance shared with the deep arm);
  `deep_anchor` = its A/B copy, peel per level =
  `Daisy → Simplify(Anchor, "hi") → Daisy2 → Daisystar`, no PartScc floors,
  incumbent floors on bare `bls`.
- Validation gate (`python3 -m survey --folder samples/validation`) passes.

## Finishing touches (mechanical, do in order)

1. **Fairness drop rules in `aut2ltl/anchor/formula.py` (BDD-only, build time).**
   In `build_final`, the park disjuncts are redundant exactly when the parked
   state's loop letters all fire its own anchor (then the `GF` disjunct already
   covers the parked run):
   - skip the `F park(s)` term for `s ∈ f_all` when
     `(L[s] & buddy.bdd_not(A[s])) == buddy.bddfalse`;
   - skip the `G L(q0)` term under the same test on `q0`.
   Soundness: only valid because `s ∈ F_all` (it carries every color) — keep the
   tests inside the existing `if m > 0` branch. Acceptance: all probe fixtures
   still `VERIFY: ok`; the gafb output must be UNCHANGED (its park is not
   droppable: `L(0) = !a|b ⊄ A(0) = b`). Add a fixture where the rule fires
   (loop letters ⊆ anchors on an F_all state) if you can craft one.

2. **Own-simplify rule `F(p ∧ X(p U q)) → F(p ∧ X q)`.**
   Valid both ways (slide to the last `p` of the block). CAUTION: the inner
   rewrite `p ∧ X(p U q) → p ∧ Xq` alone is NOT valid positionally — the rule
   only holds under `F` (an eventual context), so key it on the `F` node. Rules
   live in `aut2ltl/ltl/simplify/` (read that package's README first; follow its
   existing rule style). Acceptance:
   `python3 -m aut2ltl samples/fixtures/hoa/various/collapse_example.hoa --use deep_anchor`
   should now print `F(b & X!a)` (today: `F(b & X(b U !a))`), and the validation
   gate must stay SUCCESS.

3. **A/B + memo measurement (when asked — do NOT start benchmarks unprompted).**
   Survey `--use deep_memo` vs `--use deep_anchor` on validation, then
   benchmark; diff sizes/techniques. Memo hit rates: `tests/probes/gate_count.py`
   on kinska `counting_buchi_1ap_18` against `deep_memo` (details in the TODO.md
   Memo item). Known single-datapoint tension to settle on corpus data, not one
   example: on gafb, `daisy2`'s gated form is 6 tree nodes vs anchor's exact 17
   (anchor sits earlier as an exact producer); options are reorder (Anchor after
   Daisy2), a per-level `best_of`, or accept.

4. **Retirement of `aut2ltl/partscc/` + `aut2ltl/daisystardet/` — gated on the
   A/B, bigger than it looks.** `portfolio/builder.py`'s `daisy_trio_det*`,
   `peel*`, `core` blocks import them, and the cake*/nobls/deep_nobls* recipes
   build on those blocks — so retirement = porting or retiring those recipes
   too, plus README/CLAUDE.md layout mentions. Do not start it piecemeal.

## The k-anchor direction (bring the strong model; design agreed 2026-07-02)

Target: "k-definite modulo stuttering". THE TRAP (avoid): "the last k anchors
with stretches between them" — unbounded gaps force U-nested triggers and the
law stops being X-shaped. THE FIX: the window is over ADJACENT letters; the
stretch is absorbed by weakening the pair's FIRST component to `I(v)` (any
letter consistent with being at `v` = its loops ∨ its anchors), not `A(v)`.

k=2 data — relations over Σ×Σ (BDDs over doubled APs, transition-relation
style):
    Enter₂(s) = ⋁_{edge (v,g,s), v≠s} I(v) × g
    Stay₂(s)  = I(s) × L(s)
Preconditions (s ≠ t): P1² `Enter₂(s) ∧ Enter₂(t) = false`;
P2² `Stay₂(s) ∧ Enter₂(t) = false`; P0² q0's out-edges to distinct targets
have disjoint guards (position 0 has no predecessor; the virtual anchor gives
the source). k=1 (P1/P2 on second components) strictly implies these — try k
incrementally; k=1 stays the degenerate case.

Law: one conjunct per in-C non-self EDGE:
    step₂ = ⋀_{(v,g,s)} ( I(v) ∧ X g → XX sojourn(s) )
fair/park/LEAVE keep their shape with the pair-anchor `I(v) ∧ Xg` substituted
and one extra X; park drop rule generalizes to `Stay₂(s) ⊆ Enter₂(s)`.

Worked target `GF(a ∧ Xa)` (3-state DBA: s0 last-¬a, s1 last-a-after-¬a, s2
aa-seen accepting; P1 AND P2 fail on `a`): Enter₂(s1)=¬a×a, Enter₂(s2)=a×a,
Enter₂(s0)=a×¬a, Stay₂(s0)=¬a×¬a, Stay₂(s2)=a×a — P1²/P2² pass. Every step₂
consequence is a tautological sojourn (pure liveness), park(s2) drops by
`Stay₂ ⊆ Enter₂`, and `Final = GF(a ∧ Xa)` EXACTLY — minimal, no simplifier.
Requires one build-time collapse today's `build_final` misses (add it at k=1
already): `sojourn(s) ≡ true` when `L[s] | M[s] == buddy.bddtrue` (this is why
`!b W b` survives in the gafb output). Literature: k-testable / k-definite
languages; the law is the (k+1)-factor constraint, I(v) the stutter
abstraction. Cost: linear in edges at k=2; per-path at general k — cap at 2–3.

## 2026-07-03 — dg build step 1: morphism.py (the frozen algebra)

The Diekert-Gastin synthesis leaves the drawing board: build-order step 1
of dg/algorithm.md layer 14. `dg/morphism.py` freezes the oracle's quotient
into the canonical `Alg` value (shortlex re-keyed classes, letter map, mult
table, idempotents, P on linked pairs; all-tuple, hashable — a ready memo
key). `dg_dump.py` re-based as its display client. Validated digit-for-digit
against the layer 12–13 hand-walk tables on gf_aa_parity and
fairness_example; mod3_a still refused as non-aperiodic. First contact with
reality: zero design corrections needed.

## 2026-07-03 — dg build steps 2-5: divisor, frame, compress, formulas, synth

The DG synthesis went from design to running code in one session, following
the layer-14 build order. divisor.py (local divisor, strict-decrease assert —
fires on evenblocks' Z2). frame.py (recursion-node value: omega-universe,
conjugacy; a split the implementation demanded). compress.py (layers 4-6
tables; walk-validated digit for digit; X_{n,m} restricted to realizable
middles g(T1*) after the universe-escape assert caught it). formulas.py +
tests/smoke/dg_formulas.py: the toy-clause tests caught a genuine erratum in
[DG] Lemma 8.4 (non-strict U printed where strict XU is required; confirmed
on the PDF page; recorded in algorithm.md layer 5). synth.py: the memoized
(frame, target) induction — prepend-independence discovered and recorded.
End-to-end: gf_aa_parity and fairness_example synthesize and Spot-verify
equivalent; collapse_example builds (the mission) but its flat tree exceeds
Spot's translate budget — downstream limit, probe exit 3. Next: canonicity
probe (step 6), LTLResult wrapping, survey wiring, O(DAG) simplifier brick.

## 2026-07-03 — dg/algorithm.md sheds its DRAFT tag

Build-order steps 1-5 are landed and both walk fixtures Spot-verify, so the
document is no longer pre-implementation: header rewritten as the design and
reference document of the implemented module. Layer 11 pruned to the points
still open (O3 pivot heuristics, O6 wiring); the closed ones (O1 finite-word
logic, O2 omega-class identity, O4 worked examples, O5 architecture) reduced
to a pointer note naming the layer each resolved into. The O2 saga, for the
record: candidate 1, left-context acceptance vectors — falsified by the
fairness walk (strictly coarser than the syntactic congruence); candidate 2,
unmerged linked pairs — sound for table queries but made the T2-atom targets
unrecognized languages, an illegal induction target; final, linked-pair
conjugacy ([PP] Prop 2.6/2.8/Cor 2.9) — exact both directions, canonical,
one table scan. Dangling references rewritten in place (layer 8 "O2 merge"
-> conjugacy merge; layer 13 walk names the falsified candidate directly;
layer 5 drops the dated deep-pass aside).

## 2026-07-04 — bls/counters investigation LANDED (bf91ed09)
Why: delineate what the cascade actually covers (gate debate: form screen too
strong on gf_aa_parity, necessary on mod3_a). Paper check: counter-freeness is
load-bearing only in Prop. 6; Lemmas 4/7 unconditional on a reset cascade.
Probes casc_cover_check.py + fin_ground.py established: SgpDec cover always
genuine, only the reset premise breaks (one group letter each, parser labels
it reset unchecked), and per-Fin(C) grounding gives the law: sub-term built
correctly iff its target language is LTL (9/9). Note with crux question
(minimal form of LTL language => all Fin(C) LTL?) in
research_notes/bls_and_counters.md.

## 2026-07-04 — padded-form experiment LANDED (00973a12)
Why: settle whether the cascade can actually lie on an LTL language given a
bad (non-minimal) form. It can: gfa_pad2.hoa (GFa x acceptance-inert parity
bit) fed below decompose_aut's postprocess via tests/probes/bls_padded.py
yields a wrong buchi formula (strictly under GFa). Fallback (B) refuted;
minimization identified as a soundness component; conjecture (A) — every
Fin(C) of a minimized form of a star-free language is star-free — is now
the single open question for replacing the form gate with the SOSG oracle.
Log: research_notes/bls_and_counters.md.

## 2026-07-04 — Session: counter-freeness investigation → the SOSG paper

Long research session. Started on "does our minimization silently stand in for the
paper's counter-freeness requirement?", ended having written up two standalone
theoretical results as papers under research_notes/. Nothing in aut2ltl/ changed;
all output is research_notes/ documents (git-inspectable, per project policy).

### Investigation (research_notes/bls_and_counters.md, appended throughout)
- Literature reframe. Pulled + pdftotext'd into papers/: Diekert-Gastin 2008,
  Carton-Michel 2003, Loding 2001, Schewe 2010, Bousquet-Loding 2010,
  Carton-Rispal 2006 (LATIN; not the prophetic paper). Key facts: DG Remark 11.13
  (no canonical minimal Buchi automaton; min-size need not be counter-free);
  DG Lemma 11.2 (finite-word min DFA of aperiodic L is counter-free); DG Rem 11.14
  (subset construction preserves counter-freeness); Preugschat-Wilke loop-language
  finitary/infinitary split on Carton-Michel prophetic automata.
- Result (P), PROVEN and written up as research_notes/prophetic_counterfree.md:
  the canonical Carton-Michel (prophetic) automaton A_S of a star-free omega-language
  is counter-free (equivalently S_+ aperiodic, equivalently L star-free); hence its
  per-state loop languages (recurrence) are star-free. The omega-analogue of
  McNaughton-Papert on the right canonical object (prophetic, not minimal-det).
  Converse routes through DG Prop 11.11 (not an algebraic argument: linked-pair
  conjugacy collapses the group). Draft fixed a wrong first (=>) direction.
- Weak rung closed (Proposition W): min DWA of a star-free weak L is counter-free
  (Loding: min DWA = min DFA on residuals; residual monoid divides aperiodic S_+),
  so BLS runs inside its own hypothesis. No gap at Delta_1.
- Pi_2 conjecture ("state-minimal + star-free L => every Inf(C) star-free") REFUTED
  experimentally (research_notes/pi2_hunt_report.md, run by a separate session per
  research_notes/experiment_pi2_hunt.md): GF(a & X(b & Xb)) is star-free, minimal at
  3 states, yet Inf(C) counts mod 2; ~24% of a recurrence corpus is group-bearing.
  Also corrected an inherited error: gf_aa_parity's minimal form is aperiodic (its
  Z2 was decompose_aut postprocess padding). Upshot: minimality is the wrong
  invariant; transition-monoid aperiodicity of the grounded form is the right one;
  the gate is form-level, sound-but-incomplete.
- Q1 (does every LTL language have a constructible counter-free deterministic form?)
  left open. Best lead (user's): the right-Cayley automaton of the aperiodic
  EM(D)/~ quotient is counter-free iff LTL -- the forward mirror of A_S, constructible
  from the SOSG; open lemma is its acceptance condition (well-defined from the
  infinity set alone). Attempt via prophetic + determinization not supported by the
  literature (unambiguous-Buchi determinization is not off-the-shelf subset-based).

### The SOSG paper (the session's main deliverable)
Pivoted to writing up the definability construction itself as a standalone paper,
object-first: "The SOSG, Constructed" (research_notes/sosg_constructed.md). Thesis:
we construct the syntactic omega-semigroup from an automaton for the first time --
not blocked by size alone but by needing (1) a recognizer that sees acceptance
along runs (EM(D)) and (2) computing the two-sided syntactic congruence with
right-moves only (Arnold decomposition collapsed to ~lin + ~omega via a rotation
lemma). Main theorem EM(D)/~ = S(L). Exports (section 6): decide LTL, portable
non-LTL certificate (counting families), reify as LTL formula (Diekert-Gastin
synthesis) and as automaton (Cayley), language-equality hash. Sources: the
oracle/ and dg/ algorithm.md docs (stripped of code refs, raised to paper level).
Supporting docs: sosg_paper_outline.md (blueprint), sosg_figures_task.md
(delegation note that produced sosg_figs/), sosg_figs/figures.md + img/ (Spot
renderings + tables), sosg_format.md (v1 canonical serialization format for the
SOSG: complete invariant on its core, optional residuals, canonical AP order).
Running examples: GF(aa) (LTL, fake Z2 killed by the quotient), Even (mod-2
linear/F1), EvenBlocks (mod-2 prefix-independent/omega-power/F2), all in
single-atom !a form matching what Spot builds.
Readability passes: aired sections 3-5 on external-LLM feedback (corrected two of
the reviewer's own errors, rejected one wrong fix); reworked section 2 as a
lasso-first self-contained on-ramp ("only lassos matter" + "monoid plus loop-
forever" + "a linked pair names a lasso"); removed the LTL-characterization
paragraph from section 2 as decision material already in sections 1 and 6.1.

All research_notes/ work committed and pushed to master across the session.

## 2026-07-05 — sosg paper: finite-word specialization section
LANDED new §6 in research_notes/sosg_constructed.md (old §6-8 → §7-9): Prop 6.1
(DFA degeneration: EM = transition monoid, ~ = ~lin, quotient = syntactic monoid),
I specializes P → F, Even's finite core W = (aa)*·!a as example, LTLf read-off
[Sch65; DG08, Thm 1.1], and a single priority-stake sentence on learning the SωS
directly via the rotation lemma (right-extension observation tables). Rationale:
abstract claimed finite/infinite uniformity with no supporting body text; LTLf +
learning communities get a findable section instead of one conclusion sentence.
DV13 (De Giacomo-Vardi, LTLf) deliberately left uncited pending PDF in papers/.
Follow-up same day: DV13 PDF added to papers/, verified (Thm 3), wired into §6 together with a blind [MP71]; the one-stop [DG08, Thm 1.1] cite replaced by the stepwise chain.

## 2026-07-05 — paper 2 shadow draft started
LANDED research_notes/sos_learning.md: shadow draft (placeholder-carrying paper skeleton) for learning the SoS via the rotation lemma transported to a MAT observation-table discipline. Crux flagged: the omega-harvest counterexample lemma. Working outline absorbed into the draft and removed.

## 2026-07-05 — sos_learning: crux solved, saturation finding
LANDED the solved core into research_notes/sos_learning.md: harvest via replacement chains (stem + loop-head, junction query, binary search), the acceptance-correct-vs-algebra-correct gap as headline finding, left-saturation over class reps as the repair, saturated-fixpoint theorem (= S(L)+1, canonical export) and real complexity bounds. Crux TBDs all discharged; remaining TBDs are implementation/example-gated.

## 2026-07-05 — sos_learner_spec for delegation
LANDED research_notes/sos_learner_spec.md: standalone engineer-facing spec (tool I/O, components, soundness harness, experiments E0-E6, milestones) so implementation/experimentation can proceed off-thread while this thread stays on the math.

## 2026-07-05 — sos_learning: worked examples woven through §3-5
LANDED the Even/EvenBlocks live traces as Example paragraphs at each mechanism (day-one table, prediction miss, same-counterexample-two-shapes harvest, saturation catch, completed run). All bits hand-verified; Even endpoint matches paper-1 Table 3 and accepting pairs.

## 2026-07-06 — sosl M3: saturation + exact equivalence (LANDED)

M3 delivered. Two-sided saturation sweep (`sosl/learn/saturate.py`) and the
complete exact equivalence oracle (`sosl/teacher/exact.py`, transformation
closure of the hypothesis × D's reachable stem-configs) are wired in; `learn()`
gains a `saturation` flag (default on), `HoaTeacher` an `eq_mode` ("bounded" |
"exact"). All census languages reach the canonical invariant byte-equal with
saturation; the two proven-permanent specimens (`a_implies_xa`, `a_once`) certify
their non-canonical stalls under `--no-saturation --eq-mode exact` (spec §9 P4)
and reach canonical with saturation+exact.

Even reproduces the paper's §4.3 trace exactly (one cex `(eps,a;a;!a)`, sweep
mints the linear column `(eps,a;!a,a;a;!a)`) — pinned in
`tests/sosl/even_conformance.py`. Split + per-phase query ledgers for Even and
EvenBlocks generated by `tests/sosl/m3_ledgers.py` (deliverable to the theory
thread), reported in `sosl_report.md`.

Spec finding: the saturation branch-1 mint for OMEGA columns is wrong in spec
§3.2 step 4 — the literal `(x.r, y)` is non-splitting on a prefix-independent
language (loops forever on GF(aa)). Correct is `(x.r, y.r)`: peeling one r off the
period, `x.(r.w.y)^w = x.r.(w.y.r)^w`, so r must seed both prefix and period
suffix. This is the omega analog of the theory thread's own Lemma 4.5 correction
for the frozen-prefix chain (segment migrates into the middle, not the prefix).
Implemented `(x.r, y.r)`; `sosl/learn/algorithm.md` updated to match; flagged in
the report for a one-line spec §3.2 step 4 fix.

Also: `tests/sosl/learn_gfa_e2e.py` carried a stale pre-M2.5 2-class GF a fixture;
corrected to the canonical 3-class form. `saturate()` and
`process_counterexample()` now return a provenance label (used by the ledger
renderer). Report rewritten present-tense (prior feedback round digested and
folded in, transcript removed).
2026-07-07 — theory: sos_classification.md gains §8 self-dual/clopen dictionary, §9 Fork specimen (ϕ=(ω+1,δ), the K4 derivative fixture), §11 gen-Büchi spectrum (Prop 11.1), §12 measured census profile; sos_classifier_spec.md rev.2 binds iteration 2 (bench manifest, per-shape ventilation, spectrum law, Fork gate, (1,δ)=clopen naming fix).
2026-07-08 — theory: census must count distinct languages, not automata — spec X1 rev.2 gains (iv) 𝓘-hash dedup + abundance column + cross-path formula gate; sos_classification.md §12 owns the per-automaton correction (probe: 2state1ap1acc_buchi, 759 LTL answers ≤ 73 languages, true = 43.6%).
