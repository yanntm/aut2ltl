### 2.2 The syntactic ω-semigroup, and its invariant

Everything in this subsection is prior work — the congruence is Arnold's
[Arn85], its algebraic packaging Wilke's and Perrin–Pin's [Wil93, PP04], and
its materialization as the computable invariant `𝓘(L)`, whose notation and
results this paper adopts wholesale, is [SωS26] — restated in the exact form
the learner consumes.

**Lassos.** `Σ` is a finite alphabet (for temporal-logic applications,
`Σ = 2^AP`). A **lasso** is an ultimately-periodic word `u·v^ω`: a finite stem
`u`, a finite non-empty loop `v` repeated forever. Two ω-regular languages are
equal iff they agree on all lassos [PP04], so lassos are the only infinite
words that
ever need to be mentioned: every query below is one, and "the language" means
its lasso membership function.

**The congruence.** Fix an ω-regular `L ⊆ Σ^ω`. Two finite words are
**syntactically congruent**, `u ≈_L v`, when swapping one for the other never
changes membership; Arnold matches the swap positions to the anatomy of a
lasso — the swapped factor sits in the stem, or recurs inside the loop —
giving two context shapes [Arn85; SωS26, Def 3.5]:

```
    (linear)    ∀ x, y ∈ Σ*, t ∈ Σ⁺ :   x·u·y·t^ω ∈ L  ⟺  x·v·y·t^ω ∈ L
    (ω-power)   ∀ x, y ∈ Σ*         :   x·(u·y)^ω  ∈ L  ⟺  x·(v·y)^ω  ∈ L
```

For ω-regular `L` the congruence has **finitely many classes** [Arn85], and
its quotient, completed by the verdicts on lassos, is the **syntactic
ω-semigroup** of `L`: the exact ω-analogue of the syntactic monoid, a
function of `L` alone. The abstract algebra is two-sorted — classes of
finite words, classes of ω-words [PP04] — but on a finite carrier the second
sort is determined by the first and need not be carried [SωS26, §2]; what
this paper computes with, end to end, is the one-sorted *representation*
assembled next.

**The stamp.** The vocabulary that materializes quotients of `Σ⁺` is the
**stamp** [SωS26, Def 3.1]: a surjective semigroup morphism `𝒮 : Σ⁺ → 𝒞`
onto a finite semigroup whose elements are the **classes**, written `[u]` —
and a two-sided congruence supports exactly one: the class of a
concatenation is a function of the classes, `[u]·[v] := [u·v]` well defined.
A stamp is finitely presented by `(𝒞, λ, ·)` — the classes, the **letter
map** `λ := 𝒮|_Σ`, the multiplication table — and evaluating `𝒮` is one
table lookup per letter. It extends to all finite words by adjoining a
**fresh** identity: `M := 𝒞 ∪ {[ε]}`, `𝒮(ε) := [ε]`, making `𝒮 : Σ* → M` a
surjective monoid morphism. Freshness — `[ε]` never identified with the
class of a non-empty word — holds even when `𝒞` owns a neutral element of
its own, which happens: in `Even` below, `[aa]` multiplies as the identity
on every word class. The fresh unit costs one redundant class and buys a
guarantee the learner leans on throughout: every class other than `[ε]`
consists of non-empty words, so it carries a non-empty shortlex key, and
every representative lasso built from keys (§3) has a non-empty loop.
Canonicity is unaffected: the adjunction is a function of `L` alone
[SωS26, §3.1].

**Linked pairs name lassos.** Iterate a class: the powers `c, c², c³, …`
move in a finite semigroup, so they eventually cycle, and exactly one power
is **idempotent**; a single **exponent** `π ≥ 1` with `c^π` idempotent for
every class exists (any common multiple serves, e.g. `|𝒞|!`), and we write
`c^π` [SωS26, Def 3.2]. A **linked pair** is
a pair of classes `(s, e)` with `e·e = e` and `s·e = s`, both classes of
non-empty words — the basepoint `[ε]` appears in no pair; folding a lasso
`u·v^ω` as `(u·v^π)·(v^π)^ω` lands on one — `e = 𝒮(v)^π`, `s = 𝒮(u)·e` — and
membership of the lasso depends *only* on that pair [PP04]. So the
acceptance datum of the algebra is a set of accepting pairs, not a set of
accepting classes: loops are named separately from stems.

**The invariant.** An **invariant** is `𝓘 = ⟨𝒮, P⟩`: a stamp together with a
**pair set** `P` of linked pairs [SωS26, Def 3.3]. It decides lassos with
its own data and nothing else — **lasso membership** [SωS26, Def 3.4]: for a
presentation `(u, v)` of `w = u·v^ω`, set `e := 𝒮(v)^π`, `s := 𝒮(u)·e`; then
`w ∈ L(𝓘)` iff `(s, e) ∈ P`. The queried pair **names** the lasso, and a
lasso bears several names — already `(u, v)` and `(u·v, v)` may land on
distinct pairs. The **syntactic invariant** of `L` is
`𝓘(L) := ⟨𝒮_L, P(L)⟩` — the quotient stamp `𝒮_L : Σ⁺ → 𝒞_L := Σ⁺/≈_L`,
with the pair set collecting the names of all accepted lassos
[SωS26, Def 3.6]: the material representation of the syntactic ω-semigroup,
and the learner's target. Canonicity [SωS26, Thm I]: on `𝓘(L)`, lasso
membership is membership in `L` itself, on every presentation of every
lasso; and `𝓘` is a **complete invariant** — two ω-regular languages over
the same alphabet are equal iff a (unique) isomorphism matches their
invariants, and, with each class keyed by its shortlex-least member
(shortlex throughout this paper uses the letter order of the
serialization — valuation bitvectors ascending, so `!a < a` in the
examples), iff the serialized invariants are byte-identical. The target
answers definability directly: `L` is LTL-expressible iff no power sequence
`c, c², c³, …` cycles with period `> 1` — the aperiodicity read-off
[SωS26, Thm 6.1]. Throughout, `N` counts the classes of the target
*including* the adjoined identity — `N = |𝒞_L| + 1`, the `classes:` line of
the serialized file [SωS26, §6.2] — so class counts here match the
serialization.

**Well-formed and denoting invariants.** Two notions from [SωS26, §4]
organize everything downstream. An invariant **denotes** `L` when every
presentation of every lasso receives `L`'s verdict from lasso membership
[SωS26, Def 4.1]. An invariant is **well-formed** when its pair set is
saturated under conjugacy of linked pairs — the equivalence generated by the
rotation steps `(s, (cd)^π) ∼ (s·c, (dc)^π)` [SωS26, Def 4.2].
Well-formedness is exactly the law that gives every lasso one verdict
through all its presentations, and a well-formed invariant denotes exactly
one language, its own [SωS26, Prop 4.1]. The fact this paper leans on
hardest is [SωS26, Cor 4.2]: **an invariant denoting `L` exists exactly at
the stamps whose kernel refines `≈_L`, and over each such stamp the pair set
is forced** — the names of the accepted lassos, nothing else. Coarser than
the syntactic stamp, no invariant denotes `L` at all. §5 turns this into the
learner's canonicity argument, and §4.2's permanent stall is the phenomenon
it forbids, observed from below.

**The rotation lemma, and the membership tests.** The computational heart of
[SωS26] is a **rotation lemma** [SωS26, Lem 4.1]: a factor carried from a
loop's front onto the stem leaves the ω-word unchanged —
`x·(u·y)^ω = x·u·(y·u)^ω` — so on classes `(s·c, (dc)^π)` names the same
lasso as `(s, (cd)^π)`: a left extension of a loop is a rotation of it, a
right extension read at a shifted starting slot. The construction draws two
services from the lemma, and both transport to the query model (§4). The
first forces the conjugacy closure above: a pair set cannot help being
saturated when it speaks the truth about a language. The second makes the
two-sided congruence right-computable: [SωS26, Def 4.3] poses to each class
`c` the **membership tests**

```
    Λ(d, f)(c) = [ (d·c·f, f) ∈ P ]        Ω(d)(c) = [ (d·c^π, c^π) ∈ P ]
```

— one lasso membership each, the slot `d` ranging over the finitely many
elements of `M` — and agreement under all tests at all right extensions *is*
`≈_L` [SωS26, Lem 4.2]; that this agreement is left-invariant is the
rotation lemma again — a left factor shifts a linear test's slot and
*rotates* an ω test's loop, carrying no information of its own
[SωS26, Lem 4.3]. §3's columns are these tests sampled at word level; §4.3's
sweep is Lemma 4.3 enforced on a table the learner can only probe by
queries. ([SωS26, Thm II] packages the second service on the construction
side — canonicalization by partition refinement — but nothing below depends
on it: the learner's proofs consume Theorem I and Corollary 4.2 only.)
