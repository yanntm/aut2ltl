## Abstract

The syntactic ω-semigroup of an ω-regular language is now constructible
[SωS26], learnable [SωSL26], and exploitable for definability [SωSX26].
This paper proposes it as something more mundane and more consequential: a
*computational substrate* — the object on which the everyday operations of
an ω-automata toolbox (Spot's, say) are performed, instead of on automata.
The calculus has three primitive moves: **align** two invariants on a
common table (a generated product, the only product-priced move),
**operate** by surgery on the pair set `P` (where almost every operation
lives, almost always for free), and **reduce** to the canonical object
(re-quotient, polynomial). Complement — `2^{Θ(n log n)}` on
nondeterministic Büchi automata — is one bit-flip. Equivalence — PSPACE on
automata — is byte equality. Membership of a lasso is one fold and one
lookup. Inclusion, emptiness, universality, intersection-nonemptiness:
scans, each returning the *minimal* witness lasso. Left quotients,
rootings, pair languages, inverse substitutions: free surgeries.
Classification checks that Spot implements as constructions
(stutter-invariance, safety/co-safety, obligation, the acceptance strength
actually needed) are equations on the table, read off. The exponentials do
not disappear — they concentrate, exactly at the ω-rational constructors
(concatenation by a prefix set, ω-power) and existential projection, where
a powerset is intrinsic. The resulting picture is a *pay-canonicity-once*
economy: entering the calculus costs what determinization always cost;
staying in it makes everything downstream cheap, normal-formed, and
certificate-producing. The calculus is implemented as a small pure
library, its every decision replayable against independent oracles.

## 1. Introduction

An ω-automata toolbox — Spot [DL+16, DL+22] is the exemplar throughout —
pays for language operations with automaton constructions. Intersection
and union are products, decorated with acceptance bookkeeping —
degeneralization counters, condition rewrites.
Complementation of a nondeterministic Büchi automaton is the hard currency
of the trade: `2^{Θ(n log n)}` states, through Safra trees, rank
functions, slices, or one of their descendants [Saf88, TFVT10]. Language
inclusion and equivalence are PSPACE-complete, discharged in practice by
complement-and-product or by simulation heuristics. Each classification
query — is this property a safety property, is it stutter-invariant, what
acceptance strength does it really need — is its own bespoke construction
followed by an equivalence check. And every one of these steps returns a
*machine*: a presentation of the result, not the result itself. The output
must be re-simplified after every operation, the simplification is
heuristic and model-bound, and no normal form exists to simplify *to* —
minimal deterministic ω-automata are not unique, and even minimizing a
deterministic Büchi automaton is NP-complete [Sch10]. The costs are
per-operation and the results are never canonical.

There is a second way to hold an ω-regular language. Arnold's syntactic
congruence [Arn85] assigns to `L` a canonical finite algebra — the
syntactic ω-semigroup — which is presentation-independent and complete.
That object was for four decades a definition without a construction; it
is now built from any deterministic Emerson–Lei automaton [EL87] and
reified as
the exportable invariant `𝓘(L) = (𝒞, λ, M, P)`: a keyed class set, a
letter map, a multiplication table, and a set of accepting linked pairs
[SωS26]. The reification comes with a completeness theorem
[SωS26, Thm 5.1]: two ω-regular languages are equal iff their invariants
are byte-equal after canonical keying. The same object is learnable from
membership queries alone [SωSL26], carries the LTL frontier and its
certificates [SωSX26], and has been censused at small sizes [SωSN26].

This paper reads the completeness theorem as an API. If `𝓘(L)` *is* the
language, then operations on languages ought to be operations on
invariants — and it turns out that almost all of them are trivial ones.
The calculus we propose has three primitive moves:

1. **Align.** Put two invariants on one table, by a *generated product* —
   the reachable part of the pairing, at most `n₁·n₂` classes and often
   far fewer. This is the only move priced like an automaton product, and
   one alignment serves every subsequent operation on the pair.
2. **Operate.** Perform the operation as a surgery on pair sets over the
   fixed table. This is where the toolbox lives: complement is one flip,
   Boolean combinations are set operations, left quotients are index
   shifts, membership of a lasso is a fold and a lookup, and every
   decision procedure is a scan that emits the minimal witness lasso.
3. **Reduce.** Re-quotient the table by the congruence its own verdicts
   induce, returning *the* syntactic invariant of the result — a normal
   form, available after every step, that automata do not have.

The slogan: **align is the only product-priced move; operate is free;
reduce is the normal form.** An operation is expensive exactly when it
cannot be phrased as surgery on an aligned table, and the calculus is
honest about which those are: the ω-rational constructors — concatenation
by a prefix set, ω-power — and existential projection of an atomic
proposition quantify over a split position or a guessed run, and there a
powerset is intrinsic. Entering the calculus from a nondeterministic
acceptor embeds a determinization; no lower bound is evaded. The economic
claim is *amortization*: a pipeline that complements, conjoins, quotients,
checks and re-checks a specification pays the exponential once, at the
gate, instead of at every complement — and every intermediate result it
holds is canonical, byte-comparable, and certificate-bearing.

Contributions:

1. **The three-move decomposition** and the free-surgery catalog (§3):
   the classical toolbox — complement, union, intersection, difference,
   membership, emptiness, universality, inclusion, equivalence,
   intersection-nonemptiness, left quotient, relabeling — realized as
   pair-set surgeries and `Val`-scans over a fixed table, with the
   conjugacy-saturation law (Proposition 3.1) delimiting which pair sets
   are languages at all.
2. **The certificate discipline** (Proposition 3.2): every decision the
   calculus renders is accompanied by the *globally minimal* witness
   lasso, obtained from the scan order alone — no separate
   counterexample-extraction machinery.
3. **Read-offs replacing constructions** (§3.5): classification queries
   answered by equations on the table, including a one-scan
   stutter-invariance test (Proposition 3.3, with full proof) where the
   automata-side check builds closure automata and tests product
   emptiness.
4. **The ledger** (§4): a side-by-side of the calculus against a
   production toolbox, one row per operation, with the exponential
   frontier located exactly (§3.4). The calculus is implemented as a
   small pure library under a soundness harness whose deepest gates are
   metamorphic replay and a complement-closed corpus used as an equality
   oracle. ⟨TBD: the measured rows — V1/V2 of the companion spec.⟩

§2 recalls the object and fixes notation. §3 develops the calculus. §4
draws the ledger and states what the calculus refuses to simulate. §5
summarizes complexity; §6 positions the work; §7 concludes.

## 2. Background: the object and its oracle

We recall from [SωS26] exactly what the calculus consumes, and fix the
conventions every later scan relies on. Throughout, `Σ` is a finite
alphabet (for LTL applications `Σ = 2^AP`), `L ⊆ Σ^ω` is ω-regular, and a
**lasso** is an ultimately-periodic word `u·v^ω` with stem `u ∈ Σ*` and
loop `v ∈ Σ⁺`. Two ω-regular languages are equal iff they agree on all
lassos [PP04], so every object below is machinery for sorting lassos into
finitely many types.

**The invariant.** `𝓘(L) = (𝒞, λ, M, P)`:

- `𝒞` — the finite set of classes of Arnold's syntactic congruence, each
  keyed by its shortlex-least representative word (`key(c)`); a fresh
  identity `[ε]` is adjoined unconditionally, keyed by the empty word,
  never merged even when a non-empty class acts neutrally;
- `λ : Σ → 𝒞` — the letter map;
- `M : 𝒞 × 𝒞 → 𝒞` — the multiplication table (the Cayley table of
  `S(L)₊¹`);
- `P` — the set of **accepting linked pairs**: pairs `(s, e)` with
  `e·e = e`, `s·e = s`, `e ≠ [ε]`, such that `u·z^ω ∈ L` for
  representatives `u` of `s` and `z` of `e`.

We write `n = |𝒞|`, `fold(w)` for the left-to-right evaluation of a
finite word through `λ` and `M` (`fold(ε) = [ε]`), and `linked(𝓘)` for
the set of all linked pairs of the table. For `d ≠ [ε]`, `idem(d)`
denotes the unique idempotent in the cyclic subsemigroup
`{d, d², d³, …}`; it exists and is unique because the table is finite,
and is computed by one `O(n)` power walk, memoized.

**The membership oracle.** The central function of the calculus is the
totalization of `P` to arbitrary stem/loop classes:

```
Val_P(c, d)  :=  ( M(c, idem(d)), idem(d) ) ∈ P        c ∈ 𝒞, d ∈ 𝒞 \ {[ε]}
```

The pair `(M(c, e), e)` with `e = idem(d)` is automatically linked, so
`Val_P` is total on its domain, and the factoring theorem of the
construction gives, for every lasso,

```
u·v^ω ∈ L   ⟺   Val_P(fold(u), fold(v)).
```

The theorem has a stronger form the proofs below use: for *any* ω-word
`α` and any factorization `α = w₀·w₁·w₂·⋯` whose blocks `w_{j≥1}` all
fold to one idempotent `e`, membership is decided by the associated
pair — `α ∈ L ⟺ (fold(w₀)·e, e) ∈ P` — and Ramsey's theorem guarantees
every ω-word admits such a factorization [PP04]. Two ω-words that admit
factorizations with the same stem image and the same idempotent block
image therefore share their verdict.

Every decision procedure below is a scan of `Val` over **cells**
`(c, d) ∈ 𝒞 × (𝒞 \ {[ε]})` — the stem class `c = [ε]` encoding the empty
stem — never a scan over words.

**Cell order and canonical lassos.** The canonical lasso of a cell
`(c, d)` is `key(c)·key(d)^ω`. Cells are ordered by their canonical
lassos under the *discipline order*: shortest stem, then shortest loop,
then stem lexicographic, then loop lexicographic. Every "first cell" or
"least witness" below means least in this order; Proposition 3.2 will
show that scanning in it yields witnesses that are minimal among *all*
lassos, not merely among key-built ones.

**Completeness and canonicity.** Theorem 5.1 of [SωS26]: for a fixed
`Σ`, `𝓘(L)` determines `L` exactly — two ω-regular languages over `Σ`
are equal iff their invariants coincide, and the canonical serialization
makes "coincide" byte equality. This is the theorem the calculus
operationalizes: it licenses treating pair sets over a fixed table as
languages, and byte comparison of reduced objects as the equivalence
test.

**Notation for the calculus.** `𝓘₁ = (𝒞₁, λ₁, M₁, P₁)` and
`𝓘₂ = (𝒞₂, λ₂, M₂, P₂)` are two invariants over a common `Σ`, with
`n_i = |𝒞_i|`. A **table** is a triple `(𝒞, λ, M)` — the algebra without
its acceptance datum; one table hosts many pair sets, and the calculus's
central discipline is that pair sets are *values* over a shared,
immutable table. Not every subset of `linked(𝓘)` denotes a language; the
exact condition — saturation under conjugacy — is Proposition 3.1.

## 3. The calculus

### 3.1 Three primitive moves

Every operation below factors through three moves:

1. **Align.** Put two invariants on one table: the *generated product*
   `𝓘₁ ⊗ 𝓘₂`, with class set the submonoid of `𝒞₁ × 𝒞₂` generated by
   `{ (λ₁(a), λ₂(a)) : a ∈ Σ }` (fresh identity adjoined), letter map
   `a ↦ (λ₁(a), λ₂(a))`, componentwise multiplication, and *both* pair
   sets carried along as verdict maps
   `Val_i((c₁,c₂), (d₁,d₂)) = Val_i(c_i, d_i)`. The generated part is
   computed by a shortlex BFS from the identity pair, extending by
   letters — exactly the reachable set
   `{ (fold₁(w), fold₂(w)) : w ∈ Σ* }` — so nodes are keyed on first
   discovery and no product multiplication table is ever materialized.
   Size at most `n₁·n₂`, often far less — only the generated part
   exists. One alignment serves all subsequent operations on the pair.
   (Componentwise verdicts are sound because the cyclic idempotent is
   unique: evaluating `idem` on a component agrees with projecting an
   idempotent power of the pair.)
2. **Operate.** Surgery on pair sets over the fixed table. This is where
   the operations live, and the catalog of §3.2 is the point: almost all
   of them are `O(|P|)` or one scan.
3. **Reduce.** Re-canonicalize: quotient the table by the congruence its
   own `Val` induces. Concretely, a partition refinement: seed with the
   `O(n)`-bit signature of each class (its `Val` row as a stem against
   every loop, and its `Val` column as a loop against every stem), then
   refine to two-sided stability under every *letter* — single-letter
   stability plus the base signature suffices for full-context
   interchangeability, by the standard induction, so context triples are
   never enumerated. At most `n` Moore rounds of `O(n·|Σ|)`; the
   quotient inherits `M`, `λ`, and the image pair set, is re-keyed by
   the shortlex BFS, and *is* the syntactic invariant of the pair set's
   language. Reduction is the calculus's normal form — the move automata
   do not have (minimal deterministic ω-automata are not unique
   [Sch10]; simplification is heuristic and model-bound).

The slogan: **align is the only product-priced move; operate is free;
reduce is the normal form.** An operation is expensive exactly when it
cannot be phrased as surgery on an aligned table — §3.4 locates those.

### 3.2 The free fragment: the surgery catalog

All of the following act on a fixed table `(𝒞, λ, M)`; each is either a
query answered by lookups, or a surgery returning a pair set on the same
table, to be reduced at will. Proposition 5.11 of
[SωSX26] (decomposition never leaves LTL) is the safety net for the whole
fragment: every result's syntactic algebra divides `M`, so surgery never
escapes the variety of its table — an aperiodic table yields only
LTL-definable results, however the pair sets are cut.

- **Lasso membership.** `member(P, u, v) := Val_P(fold(u), fold(v))`:
  `O(|u| + |v|)` table lookups (plus one memoized idempotent walk). This
  is not an operation *built from* the oracle — it *is* the oracle, the
  function every other entry scans. On automata the same query runs the
  word against the machine and inspects the loop's acceptance; here the
  automaton-shaped work (the fold) is the whole cost, and the verdict is
  a set lookup.
- **Boolean algebra.** `P₁ ∪ P₂`, `P₁ ∩ P₂`, `P^c` (relative to the
  linked pairs), differences, xor: the same-table languages form a
  *finite Boolean algebra*, isomorphic to the algebra of saturated pair
  sets, because `Val` commutes pointwise with every set operation (the
  flip and the joins act after the same `(M(c,e), e)` lookup). Complement
  is one flip — against `2^{Θ(n log n)}` for nondeterministic Büchi
  complementation [TFVT10], this is the calculus's headline entry — and
  the constants are `∅` (empty language) and `linked(𝓘)` (universal).
- **Rooting (left quotients).** For `c ∈ 𝒞` define
  `P_c := { (s, e) linked : (c·s, e) ∈ P }`. Well-defined — `(c·s, e)` is
  linked when `(s, e)` is — and `Val_{P_c}(x, d) = Val_P(c·x, d)`, so
  `L(P_c) = u⁻¹L` for any representative `u` of `c` (in particular
  `P_{[ε]} = P`): prefix subtraction is pair surgery. The rootings form a right `M`-action,
  `P_{c·d} = (P_c)_d`, so quotients compose as they must
  (`(uv)⁻¹L = v⁻¹(u⁻¹L)`), and the number of distinct rootings *is* the
  residual count read-off [SωS26, Prop 4.6]: the residual automaton of
  `L`, internalized. In particular `L` is prefix-independent iff all
  rootings equal `P`. These rootings are exactly the memoized class
  children of the extraction [SωSX26, §5.2], and Lemma 5.9 there (reach
  absorption) is a rooting identity.
- **Pair languages and prolongations.** The pair classes are the
  conjugacy classes, and conjugacy is a law about *cells*, not pairs:

  **Proposition 3.1 (conjugacy and saturation).** For every linked pair
  `(s, e)` and every factorization `e = x·y`:
  `s·e^ω = (s·x)·(y·x)^ω`, so the cells `(s, e)` and `(s·x, y·x)` carry
  one verdict. The conjugate cell renormalizes to the linked pair
  `((s·x)·f, f)` with `f = (y·x)^π` — and the renormalization is not
  optional: `x·y` idempotent does not make `y·x` idempotent; only
  `(y·x)²` is guaranteed to be (`(yx)³ = y·(xy)²·x = (yx)²`), so the
  naive pair-level transport `(s, e) ↦ (s·x, y·x)` leaves the linked
  pairs. Two linked pairs denote the same ω-word class iff the closure
  under these renormalized moves connects them [PP04]; a set of linked
  pairs is a language over the table iff it is a union of such classes —
  *saturated*. (Conjugacy is symmetric — swap `x` and `y` — so the
  closure is a union of conjugacy classes; the fixpoint costs
  `O(|linked|·n²)` and doubles as the legality check for arbitrary pair
  sets. Every surgery in this catalog preserves saturation, and the
  implementation's harness asserts it on every output.)

  Any saturated `P'` is then a language: a single class gives "the words
  realizing exactly this accepting behavior" — *prolonging the language
  from one of its behaviors*, the finest granularity of the OR-split
  combinator [SωSX26, §5.6], with its Wagner-ladder guard.
- **Inverse substitutions.** For `π : Σ' → Σ` (relabeling, letter
  merging, alphabet extension by duplication): compose `λ ∘ π`, same
  table, reduce — the reachable part may shrink, so the result meets the
  normal form before any byte-level use. Inverse morphic images are
  free; Spot's `relabel` is a special case.
- **Canonical witnesses.** Every nonempty pair set carries its own
  certificate: `(s, e) ∈ P` yields the lasso `key(s)·key(e)^ω`, shortlex
  keys giving *the* canonical witness word. A witness or counterexample
  is read off in the same scan as the decision it certifies — the
  certificate discipline of [SωSX26, §4], available to every operation.
  And the witness is not merely canonical:

  **Proposition 3.2 (the canonical witness is minimal).** Order lassos
  by stem length, then loop length, then lexicographically, and scan
  cells `(c, d)` in the order of their lassos `key(c)·key(d)^ω`. For any
  property that factors through the membership oracle, the first
  satisfying cell's lasso is the least satisfying lasso *among all
  lassos*: a satisfying `(u, v)` lives in the cell
  `(fold(u), fold(v))`, whose keys are shortlex-least in their classes,
  so the cell's lasso dominates it componentwise. Every certificate the
  calculus emits — an emptiness witness, an inclusion or equivalence
  counterexample — is therefore the minimal one, and a client consuming
  counterexamples (the learner's teacher [SωSL26]) inherits its
  minimal-order guarantee from the scan order alone.
- **Decision procedures as scans.** All of the following scan cells in
  the discipline order and return the verdict together with the least
  witnessing cell's lasso; by Proposition 3.2 that witness is globally
  minimal.
  - *Emptiness*: `P = ∅`; otherwise the least cell with `Val_P` true
    furnishes the witness. (Scan cells, not `P` itself: the least *pair*
    in `P` is not in general the least *cell* — a short non-idempotent
    loop key maps into a long-keyed linked pair.)
  - *Universality*: emptiness of `P^c` — one flip away, where automata
    pay a full complementation before their emptiness check.
  - *Inclusion* `L₁ ⊆ L₂` (same or aligned table): the pointwise test
    `Val₁ ≤ Val₂`; the first cell with `Val₁ ∧ ¬Val₂` yields the
    canonical separating lasso. Compare: PSPACE-complete on automata,
    with counterexamples needing product-emptiness runs.
  - *Equivalence*: on two *reduced* invariants, byte equality of the
    canonical serializations [SωS26, Thm 5.1] — no scan at all, one
    comparison linear in the artifact size. On an
    aligned pair, one scan of `Val₁ ≠ Val₂` decides both inclusion
    defects in a single pass and returns the least disagreeing cell as
    counterexample; the two routes agree wherever both apply.
  - *Intersection-nonemptiness with witness* (the model-checking-shaped
    query, Spot's `intersecting_word`): least cell with `Val₁ ∧ Val₂`.

### 3.3 The aligned fragment

Cross-table operations pay the alignment price `O(n₁·n₂·|Σ|)` once:

- **Union / intersection / difference / xor across tables**: align, then
  §3.2 pointwise. Note what is *absent*: no acceptance-condition
  surgery. Büchi intersection needs degeneralization counters, union of
  deterministic models may not exist in the same acceptance class,
  generalized conditions need bookkeeping; here acceptance is a pair set
  and conjunction is pointwise `∧` of verdicts.
- **Model-checking-shaped queries**: `L₁ ∩ L₂ = ∅?` is align + scan of
  `Val₁ ∧ Val₂` + canonical witness. Same product asymptotics as
  automata, plus the normal form and the certificate.
- **When alignment stays small.** The generated product materializes
  only `{ (fold₁(w), fold₂(w)) : w ∈ Σ* }` — the correlation the two
  languages actually exhibit, not the rectangle `𝒞₁ × 𝒞₂`. This is the
  calculus's own notion of "on-the-fly": exactly as a model checker
  builds only reachable product states, `align` builds only realizable
  class pairs. The two regimes are instructive. When the operands are
  related — one refines the other, both were produced by surgery from a
  common ancestor table, both constrain the same letters — folds
  correlate and the generated part collapses toward the larger factor
  (in the limit, aligning a table with itself is the diagonal, and the
  implementation short-circuits it). When the operands are genuinely
  independent — constraints over disjoint atomic propositions — the
  generated part *is* essentially the full rectangle, and that is not an
  artifact: the intersection of independent constraints genuinely
  multiplies behaviors. The realized ratio `|nodes| / (n₁·n₂)` is a
  datum the implementation records per alignment. ⟨TBD: its distribution
  over census pairs — V1.⟩ One further economy is structural: an
  aligned product is a table like any other, so a *session* of
  operations on the same pair — inclusion both ways, intersection,
  difference, their emptiness checks — pays its BFS once.

### 3.4 The exponential frontier

The calculus is honest about where powersets are intrinsic:

- **Concatenation by a prefix set (`W·L`) and ω-power (`W^ω`).** The
  ω-rational constructors quantify existentially over a split position:
  `α ∈ W·L` asks for *some* factorization `α = w·β` with `w ∈ W`,
  `β ∈ L`. A `Val`-scan over a fixed table evaluates one factorization
  type per cell; no surgery on an aligned table expresses an existential
  over factorizations — and none could, because the result's algebra can
  be exponentially larger than both operands':

  **Proposition 3.4 (concatenation blows up).** Over `Σ = {a, b, #}`,
  let `W = Σ*·#` (a three-element syntactic monoid: the last letter is
  `#` or it is not) and
  `L_n = { α : α contains a b, and the number of a's before the first b
  is ≡ 0 mod n }`, whose invariant has at most `2n + 1` classes (a phase
  counter mod `n` that freezes at the first `b`: `n` `b`-free classes,
  `n` frozen ones, `[ε]`). Then `𝓘(W·L_n)` has at least `2^n − 1`
  classes.

  *Proof.* `α ∈ W·L_n` iff some `#` of `α` is followed by a `b`, with
  the a-count strictly between that `#` and the first subsequent `b`
  divisible by `n` — each `#` opens a *thread* carrying the phase "a's
  seen since this `#`", and all live threads resolve together at the
  next `b`. For a nonempty `S = {s₁ < ⋯ < s_m} ⊆ {0, …, n−1}` let

  ```
  u_S  =  #·a^{s_m − s_{m−1}}·#·a^{s_{m−1} − s_{m−2}}·#·⋯·#·a^{s₁}
  ```

  a `b`-free word whose `j`-th `#` is followed by exactly `s_{m−j+1}`
  letters `a`: the live phases of `u_S` are exactly `S`. For any phase
  `φ`, the suffix `v_φ = a^{(n−φ) mod n}·b^ω` opens no thread
  (`#`-free) and resolves every live phase `ψ` at its `b` with total
  count `ψ + (n−φ) ≡ ψ − φ (mod n)`; hence
  `u_S·v_φ ∈ W·L_n ⟺ φ ∈ S`. The residuals `u_S⁻¹(W·L_n)` are
  therefore pairwise distinct, and distinct residuals are distinct
  rootings, which are indexed by classes (§3.2):
  `|𝒞(W·L_n)| ≥ 2^n − 1`. ∎

  The residuals in the proof are the subset-tracking of `L_n`'s phase
  counter — the subset construction, resurfacing in the algebra: this
  is where the nondeterminism that automata carry natively re-enters
  (an NBA for `W·L_n` guesses the split and stays linear in `n`).
  ω-power hides the same existential — a factorization into infinitely
  many `W`-blocks — and is expected to behave alike, though we exhibit
  only the concatenation half. Constructions exist on the algebraic
  side [PP04] but cost what determinization costs: the honest route is
  exit to an acceptor, apply the constructor, re-enter through the
  gate. ⟨TBD: whether the census [SωSN26] shows the blowup is rare at
  small sizes — V1's scope.⟩
- **Existential projection (`remove_ap`).** Quantifying an atomic
  proposition away is the QPTL wall met in [SωSX26, §6]: a deterministic
  definitional extension is free (it is an inverse substitution, §3.2 —
  *adding* letters costs nothing), a genuine guess is a powerset. Spot
  pays the same, differently distributed.
- **Entry price.** Constructing `𝓘(L)` from a nondeterministic acceptor
  embeds a determinization, and the construction itself is dominated by
  the enriched-monoid closure [SωS26, §8]; the calculus does not evade
  lower bounds, it *relocates* them to the entry gate. The economic
  claim is amortization: **pay canonicity once, then operate in the free
  fragment.** A specification pipeline that complements `k` times pays
  Safra `k` times on automata and zero times here; a pipeline that
  interleaves Boolean structure with equivalence checks pays PSPACE per
  check there and byte comparisons here; and every intermediate object
  it holds is already in normal form, so nothing is ever re-simplified.
  ⟨TBD: the worked pipeline with measured cumulative costs — V1's
  "pay canonicity once" demo.⟩

### 3.5 Read-offs replace constructions

Spot answers classification queries by building automata and testing
them; on the invariant the same queries are equations on the table. The
first is worked in full, as the pattern for the rest.

**Stutter invariance, one scan.** Two ω-words are *stutter-equivalent*
iff they have the same destuttered normal form, where destuttering
collapses every maximal finite block of equal consecutive letters to one
letter (an eventually-constant word `u·a^ω` has normal form
`destutter(u·a)·a^ω`). `L` is stutter-invariant iff it is a union of
stutter classes.

**Proposition 3.3.** `L` is stutter-invariant iff `λ(a)·λ(a) = λ(a)`
for every letter `a ∈ Σ`.

*Proof.* (⇒) Fix `a ∈ Σ`; we show `a ≈_L a·a` in Arnold's congruence,
whence `λ(a) = λ(a·a) = λ(a)²` since the syntactic morphism is
multiplicative. In the linear shape, for any `x, y ∈ Σ*`, `t ∈ Σ⁺`, the
words `x·a·y·t^ω` and `x·a·a·y·t^ω` differ by duplicating one letter
occurrence, so they destutter identically and stutter invariance gives
them one verdict. In the ω-power shape, for any `x, y ∈ Σ*`,
`x·(a·y)^ω` and `x·(a·a·y)^ω` differ by duplicating one `a` inside each
loop iteration — infinitely many duplications, but destuttering
collapses each `a·a` block the same way in both, so the normal forms
again coincide and stutter invariance again gives one verdict. Both
shapes agree on `a` versus `a·a`, so `a ≈_L a·a`.

(⇐) Suppose every letter class is idempotent. First, on finite words,
`fold(w) = fold(destutter(w))`: collapsing one adjacent equal pair
`…a·a… ↦ …a…` preserves the fold by `λ(a)² = λ(a)` and
multiplicativity; induct on the number of collapses. It suffices to show
that every ω-word `α` has the same verdict as its normal form `β`, since
stutter-equivalent words share their normal form.

*Case 1: `α` eventually constant*, `α = u·a^ω`. Its factorization
`u, a, a, a, …` has all loop blocks folding to the idempotent
`λ(a)`, so by the factoring theorem (§2) the verdict of `α` is
`Val_P(fold(u), λ(a))`, i.e. membership of the linked pair
`(fold(u)·λ(a), λ(a))` in `P`. Now `fold(u)·λ(a) = fold(u·a) =
fold(destutter(u·a))` by the finite-word fact, and the normal form
`β = destutter(u·a)·a^ω` evaluates on the same pair (its stem folds to
`fold(destutter(u·a))`, which already ends in `λ(a)` and is absorbed).
Same cell, same verdict.

*Case 2: letters change infinitely often.* Write the normal form as
`β = b₀b₁b₂⋯` with `b_i ≠ b_{i+1}`; then `α = b₀^{k₀}·b₁^{k₁}·⋯` for
some exponents `k_i ≥ 1`. By Ramsey (§2), `β` admits a factorization
`β = w₀·w₁·w₂·⋯` with `fold(w_j) = e` idempotent for all `j ≥ 1`. Every
cut point of this factorization sits between two *distinct* letters —
`β` is stutter-free — so it marks a block boundary of `α`, and cutting
`α` at those boundaries blows each factor `w_j = b_i⋯b_m` up to
`w_j' = b_i^{k_i}⋯b_m^{k_m}`, whose destuttered form is `w_j` itself
(adjacent letters inside `w_j` differ). By the finite-word fact
`fold(w_j') = fold(w_j)`, so `α = w₀'·w₁'·w₂'·⋯` is a factorization
with the same stem image `fold(w₀)` and the same idempotent block image
`e` as `β`'s, and the strong factoring theorem of §2 gives both words
one verdict. ∎

Spot's check [MD15] translates the property *and its negation* to Büchi
automata, applies closure constructions — `cl` (destuttering) and `sl`
("self-loopization", instuttering) — and tests emptiness of products
such as `sl(A) ⊗ sl(Ā)`: two translations, two closures, one product
emptiness. Here it is `|Σ|` table lookups. (The comparison is fair in
one direction only — [MD15] starts from a formula, we start from the
invariant — but in a pipeline that already holds `𝓘(L)`, the marginal
cost of the query is the point.)

The rest of the classification battery follows the same pattern —
a construction on automata, an equation on the table:

- **The safety–progress ladder** (safety, co-safety/guarantee,
  obligation, recurrence, persistence, reactivity): each rung is a
  closure condition on the accepting set `P` over the linked-pair
  structure [SωS26, §7.2; Lan69, MP92, PW13] — Spot's `is_safety`,
  `is_obligation`, … as scans, uniform over one object where the
  automata-side answers are model-specific checks.
- **Acceptance strength needed** (Spot's parity/Rabin-index style
  queries): the acceptance index — the minimal deterministic condition
  the *language* needs — is the maximal alternating chain in the
  algebra, computable in the syntactic ω-semigroup by Carton–Perrin
  [CP97, Cor. 1]; a property of the language, not of a chosen condition.
- **Wagner degree**: the complete classification up to Wadge
  reducibility is fixed by the chain and superchain structure of the
  algebra [CP97, CP99, SW08]; every hierarchy query above specializes
  it.
- **LTL-definability and extraction**: the aperiodicity scan on `M`,
  then [SωSX26] for the defining formula or the counting-family
  certificate. (Spot has no automaton→LTL path.)
- **Hulls, conjecturally.** The safety closure of `L`, its liveness
  part, and the decomposition `L = safety ∩ liveness` look like
  `P`-completions along the ladder characterizations — surgery plus
  reduction, plausibly polynomial. ⟨TBD: work out the safety-hull pair
  set; prove or refute polynomiality; this may deserve its own
  section — the temporal hierarchy as a lattice of hulls on one
  table.⟩

## 4. The ledger against a production toolbox

The table below sets the calculus against an automata toolbox, one row
per everyday entry point, with Spot [DL+16, DL+22] as the reference
implementation of the automata column. The pattern of the columns is the
paper's thesis in miniature: the automata side pays per operation and
returns machines; the calculus side pays at `align` (at worst) and
returns pair sets one `reduce` away from canonical.

| operation | automata (Spot) | on `𝓘(L)` |
|---|---|---|
| complement | `2^{Θ(n log n)}` (Safra/rank/slice [TFVT10]) | `P ↦ P^c`, free |
| union / intersection / difference | product (+ acceptance surgery) | align `O(n₁n₂)` + pointwise `∨/∧/∖` |
| emptiness + witness | SCC scan | `P = ∅?`, key-built minimal lasso |
| universality | complement + emptiness | `P = linked?`, scan |
| inclusion / equivalence | PSPACE / simulations | `Val₁ ≤ Val₂` scan / byte equality |
| lasso membership | run the lasso against the machine | one fold through `λ, M`, one `P` lookup |
| left quotient | derivative construction | rooting `P_c`, free |
| relabel / inverse subst. | rebuild | compose `λ`, free |
| determinize | Safra/Zielonka | *meaningless* — object already canonical-deterministic; the cost sits at entry |
| degeneralize / to-parity / acc transforms | bespoke constructions | *dissolved* — acceptance is `P`; the needed strength is a read-off |
| minimize / simulation reductions | heuristic, model-bound (NP-c for DBA [Sch10]) | reduce: the normal form, always, uniquely |
| stutter-invariance | `cl`/`sl` closures + product emptiness [MD15] | `λ(a)² = λ(a)` scan (Prop 3.3) |
| safety/obligation/… tests | model-specific checks | ladder scans on `P` |
| acceptance index / Rabin index | condition transforms + tests | alternating-chain read-off [CP97] |
| concatenation `W·L`, `W^ω` | native (nondeterminism) | exponential — intrinsic (§3.4) |
| projection `remove_ap` | subset-flavored | exponential — the QPTL wall (§3.4) |
| automaton → LTL | absent | [SωSX26] on the aperiodic side |

**Exit constructions.** The calculus should end where the consumer
needs. To an NBA: the classical decomposition
`L = ⋃_{(s,e) ∈ P} X_s·(Y_e)^ω` over accepting pairs [PP04], where
`X_c = { w : fold(w) = c }` is recognized by the right-Cayley DFA of the
table (`|𝒞|` states, final state `c`), gives an acceptor polynomial in
`|𝒞|` — `O(|P|·|𝒞|)` states by the standard stem–loop gadget. To LTL:
via [SωSX26] when the table is aperiodic. To certificates: the
witness/replay formats of [SωSX26, §4], always.

**What cannot be simulated.** Anything needing branching semantics
(games, synthesis) — the invariant is a linear-time object. And
succinctness: `𝓘(L)` can be exponentially larger than a good
nondeterministic presentation; the census [SωSN26] measures how often
canonicity actually costs. The honest positioning: the calculus is not a
back-end for one-shot translations; it is the substrate for pipelines
that *keep* a language and work on it.

**Implementation.** The calculus is implemented as a small pure library
(the companion specification `sos_calculus_spec.md` fixes the package,
the algorithms, and the milestones; align/operate/reduce and the full
catalog above are in place). Every decision returns a replayable witness
object; the soundness harness's deepest gates are (i) *metamorphic
replay* — for every operation, membership in the result equals the
corresponding Boolean combination of memberships in the inputs, checked
exhaustively over all lassos with `|u|, |v| ≤ 3`; (ii) the *saturation
law* — every catalog output is saturated in the sense of Proposition
3.1, asserted on every harness case; (iii) a *duality gate* — the census
corpus is complement-closed, so `reduce(P^c)` must byte-equal the stored
complement on every corpus language; and (iv) the *corpus as equality
oracle* — the canonical corpus holds one file per language, so
`equivalent` must agree with filename identity, and every counterexample
on a cross-file pair must replay against both sides. ⟨TBD: the measured
ledger rows and alignment-ratio distribution — V1; the stutter read-off
against Spot's verdict over the census — V2.⟩

## 5. Complexity summary

One line per move; `n` is the class count of the relevant table,
`linked ⊆ 𝒞²` its linked pairs, and costs count table lookups /
`Val` evaluations (each `O(1)` after memoization).

| move / query | cost | output |
|---|---|---|
| entry: construct `𝓘(L)` from `D` | dominated by `|EM(D)| ≤ (|Q|·2^{|C|})^{|Q|}` [SωS26, §8] | the invariant |
| align | `O(n₁·n₂·|Σ|)` steps, `≤ n₁·n₂` nodes | shared table + two verdict maps |
| Boolean surgeries, rooting | `O(|linked|)` | pair set, same table |
| saturation / legality check | `O(|linked|·n²)` | pair set (run rarely) |
| inverse substitution | `O(|Σ'|)` + reduce | same table, new letter map; reduce before byte-level use |
| lasso membership | `O(|u| + |v|)` | bit |
| emptiness / universality | `O(n²)` `Val` | bit + minimal lasso |
| inclusion / equivalence / intersection-word | `O(|nodes|²)` verdicts on the aligned table | bit + minimal lasso |
| equivalence of reduced objects | byte comparison | bit |
| reduce | `O(n²)` `Val` + `≤ n` rounds × `O(n·|Σ|)` | *the* canonical invariant |
| stutter-invariance | `O(|Σ|)` | bit (Prop 3.3) |
| ladder / index / Wagner read-offs | polynomial scans of the table | verdicts [SωS26, §7.2] |
| `W·L`, `W^ω`, `remove_ap` | exponential (exit + re-entry) | §3.4 |

The entry row is not an apology but a floor: deciding aperiodicity of an
ω-regular language — one read-off among the ones the object supports —
is already PSPACE-complete (hardness from the finite-word case [CH91],
the ω transfer as in [SωS26, §8] via [DG08]), so *some*
exponential must sit somewhere in any substrate this complete. The
calculus's design choice is to sit it at the gate, once, rather than
inside every operation.

## 6. Related work

**Automata toolboxes.** Spot [DL+16, DL+22] is the reference point
throughout §4: a mature, carefully-engineered library in which every
language operation is an automaton construction and every classification
query a construction-plus-test — the stutter-invariance battery of
[MD15] being the type specimen of the latter. Notably, Spot already
committed to the most general acceptance (arbitrary Emerson–Lei
conditions over the HOA format [DL+16]), which is the automata-side echo
of this calculus's stance that acceptance is data, not architecture;
the calculus takes the last step and makes it a *set*, closed under the
Boolean algebra. The complementation problem it must solve per
negation has a five-decade literature of its own, surveyed and measured
in [TFVT10]; the absence of a normal form on the automata side is not an
engineering gap but a theorem-shaped obstacle — minimal deterministic
Büchi automata are not unique and are NP-hard to find [Sch10]. The
calculus does not compete with these tools at their own game (one-shot
translation, model checking against a system); it changes the object so
that the game is different.

**Recognition by ω-semigroups.** The algebraic theory the calculus
operates in is classical: ω-semigroups and their linked pairs, the
ω-rational operations, and the conjugacy analysis of pair classes are
the material of Perrin and Pin [PP04]; Wilke's algebras [Wil93] give the
equivalent finite signature, and Maler–Staiger [MS97] the congruence
landscape around Arnold's. What that literature does not do is *operate*:
the algebra recognizes, characterizes, classifies — it is not treated as
a data structure with a surgery catalog and a normal-form move. The
missing precondition was the object itself, constructed [SωS26].

**Canonical automata.** Carton–Michel's unambiguous (prophetic) Büchi
automata [CM03] give a canonical *acceptor* — existence and uniqueness,
of automaton-theoretic rather than operational vocation, and the natural
exit format for §4's exit constructions on the non-deterministic side.
The residual structure the rooting surgery internalizes (§3.2) is on the
automata side the subject of the FDFA/family-of-DFAs line
[AF16, ABF18, AF21]: families of right congruences as acceptors,
canonical in their own terms and learnable. The syntactic invariant is
coarser-grained machinery — a two-sided congruence with its
multiplication — and it is exactly the two-sided table that turns
classifications into equations (idempotency of letter classes, conjugacy
of pairs) that right congruences cannot phrase.

**Finite-word proxies.** Closest in spirit to "operate on a canonical
object" is the `L_$` construction of Calbrix–Nivat–Podelski [CNP93]: the
regular finite-word language `{u$v : u·v^ω ∈ L}` determines `L`, its
minimal DFA is canonical, and Boolean operations transfer. The calculus
can be read as the algebraic completion of that program: the invariant
also determines `L` and also carries Boolean structure, but additionally
exposes the multiplication — and with it the read-offs (aperiodicity,
the ladder, the index, the Wagner degree) and the surgeries (rooting,
conjugacy-saturated prolongations) that a DFA over a `$`-alphabet keeps
implicit.

**Hierarchy computations on the algebra.** That the Wagner hierarchy is
computable in the syntactic ω-semigroup is Carton–Perrin [CP97, CP99],
completed by Selivanov–Wagner's complexity analysis [SW08]; Landweber's
ladder [Lan69] and its effective characterizations on canonical automata
[PW13] are the automata-side counterparts. §3.5 claims none of these
results — it claims their *placement*: on one shared table, as scans
among other scans, downstream of one entry price.

Position: none of these lines treats the syntactic object as an
*operational* substrate — a thing one aligns, cuts, and re-normalizes —
with the decision procedures, the certificate discipline, and the
normal-form move packaged as a calculus. That is this paper's claim.

## 7. Conclusion

Recognition is usually consumed as a verdict: the algebra accepts, the
characterization holds, the hierarchy level is such. This paper consumes
it as a calculus. Three moves — align, the only product-priced one;
operate, the free surgery catalog on pair sets; reduce, the normal form
automata never had — carry the everyday toolbox: a Boolean algebra of
languages with complements for free, residuals as an internal action,
decisions as scans that emit minimal certificates, classifications as
equations read off the table. The exponentials concentrate where they
are intrinsic — the entry gate, the ω-rational constructors, existential
projection — and the economy is pay-canonicity-once: a pipeline that
keeps a language and works on it pays determinization at the door and
nothing per operation after.

The calculus is the operational face of a program whose other faces are
already drafted: [SωS26] builds the object, [SωSL26] learns it (and its
teacher consumes this paper's minimal counterexamples), [SωSX26] is its
most elaborate derived operation, and the census [SωSN26] counts the
universe it operates on. What remains here is measurement — the V1/V2
ledger against Spot on the census corpus — and one piece of theory the
draft marks in place: the hull conjecture of §3.5, the temporal
hierarchy as a lattice of `P`-completions on one table.
