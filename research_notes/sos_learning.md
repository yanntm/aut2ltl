## Abstract

The syntactic ω-semigroup of a regular ω-language `L` is its canonical
algebra: presentation-independent, complete, and the object from which
membership, equivalence, and every definability property of `L` —
LTL-definability included — are read. It was recently materialized as a
computable, serializable invariant `𝓘(L)`, constructed from a deterministic
automaton [SωS26]. This paper shows the invariant is *learnable*: an
active-learning algorithm in Angluin's MAT model whose only queries are
memberships of ultimately-periodic words, and whose limit is `𝓘(L)` itself —
to our knowledge the first learner for the full ω-regular class whose target
is a canonical object of the language, rather than an acceptor chosen from a
family. Counterexamples do half the work: any lasso on which a hypothesis
errs surrenders a separating table column. The other half they provably
cannot do: membership's error signal is one-sided, and the learner can
stabilize on a correct acceptor strictly coarser than the algebra,
*permanently*, already on a language as plain as `a → Xa` — and such a
certified stall never carries an algebra at all. What restores two-sidedness
is a saturation sweep whose checks cost no queries, and with it the fixpoint
is exactly the syntactic invariant, at output-polynomial query cost. On a
complement-closed census of 6222 languages the learner reconstructs every
syntactic invariant byte-for-byte; half of them stall permanently without
the sweep; and LTL-definability is read off each learned invariant — a
question no family of acceptors answers.

## 1. Introduction

Active learning asks a machine to reconstruct an unknown language *exactly*,
from experiments alone. In Angluin's minimally adequate teacher (MAT) model
[Ang87] the learner poses membership queries — is this word in the
language? — and equivalence queries — is this hypothesis the language?,
answered by *yes* or by a counterexample — and the L\* algorithm learns the
minimal DFA of any regular language with polynomially many queries. The
paradigm's reach is practical — assume–guarantee verification [FCC+08],
state machines learned from black-box implementations of smart cards and
network protocols [Vaa17] — but its engine is a theorem: by Myhill–Nerode,
the right congruence of the language *is* its minimal acceptor. Everything
one wants from L\* flows from the canonicity of that target: progress is
irreversible, cost is measured against the language's own invariant, and
questions about the language are answered on the learned object itself.

On infinite words the query interface survives — ultimately-periodic words,
*lassos*, are finite objects that determine an ω-regular language
completely — but the engine fails: the right congruence of an ω-regular
language can be trivial while the language is complex [AF21]. There is no
minimal deterministic ω-automaton to converge to, and the history of
ω-learning is a history of substitute targets: the subclass where the right
congruence still carries everything [MP95], encodings back into finite words
[FCC+08], and the standard modern route, *families of DFAs* (FDFAs) in three
competing canonical forms, the choice among them the learner's [AF16,
ABF18]. All of these targets are acceptors. None is an object of the
language alone, and none answers a definability question without further
construction.

Yet the canonical object exists. Arnold's syntactic congruence [Arn85]
quotients finite words by interchangeability in every lasso context — in
the stem, or inside the loop — and its quotient, the syntactic ω-semigroup,
is the exact ω-analogue of the syntactic monoid. It was recently
materialized as the invariant `𝓘(L)`: a finite classifier of finite words
plus a set of accepting stem–loop pairs, serialized to a byte-canonical
file, constructed from a deterministic automaton [SωS26]. The key step there
is a *rotation lemma*: carrying a factor from a loop's front onto the stem
leaves the infinite word unchanged — a left extension of a loop is nothing
but a rotation of it.

This paper shows the same object is learnable, and by the same lemma — which
is not about automata at all. Transported to the query model it splits in
two. One half turns any lasso the hypothesis gets wrong into a new column of
the table: counterexamples pay their way, as they do in L\*. The other half
turns left contexts — the two-sided congruence's whole difficulty — into a
sweep of table checks that cost no queries at all.

That sweep is not an optimization, and its necessity is the paper's central
finding — one we did not anticipate. Membership queries can only catch a
hypothesis that mispredicts some lasso, and that error signal is one-sided:
the learner can stabilize on a correct *acceptor* strictly coarser than the
algebra, every prediction right, the equivalence oracle assenting —
permanently. The stall is not exotic. We searched for the smallest
realization and found a two-letter implication: on `a → Xa` the sweep-free
learner converges, with zero counterexamples, one class short of the
algebra — and we prove no counterexample can ever arrive. Nor is the result
merely one class short: a certified stall's classes carry no algebra at
all. The refinement loop that drives L\* — and every ω-learner since — has
nothing left to react to; what breaks the stall must be a query the learner
poses on its own initiative. The sweep is that query, and it closes the gap
exactly.

**Contributions.**

1. A learning algorithm for the syntactic invariant `𝓘(L)` of any ω-regular
   language — to our knowledge the first: plain lasso membership and
   equivalence queries, no algebra mid-learning, and a limit byte-equal to
   what the construction of [SωS26] produces (§3–§4).
2. A structural finding: counterexample-guided refinement is provably not
   enough at ω. The learner stalls permanently on languages as simple as
   `a → Xa`, certified correct as an acceptor yet carrying no algebra; a
   query-free saturation sweep repairs it, the repaired fixpoint is exactly
   the syntactic invariant, and the query cost is output-polynomial (§4–§5).
3. Experimental evidence from a complete tool implementation: on a
   complement-closed census of 6222 languages every syntactic invariant is
   reconstructed byte-for-byte, half the census stalls without the sweep,
   and a comparison to the state-of-the-art FDFA learner ROLL shows
   comparable sizes and queries — with LTL-definability read off our result,
   and not off theirs (§6).

The closest prior work, Urbat and Schröder's algebraic automata learning
[US20], identified the syntactic algebra as the right learnable target for
ω-regular languages — but obtained no effective algorithm: their instance
needs infinitely many alphabet letters, one per possible loop, known in
advance. The rotation lemma supplies the missing finiteness; §7 details the
comparison.


## 2. Background

This section fixes notation and recalls the two bodies of prior work the
paper stands on: active learning in the MAT model (§2.1), and the syntactic
theory of ω-regular languages in the invariant form of [SωS26] (§2.2); §2.3
introduces the running examples and the teacher used in the experiments.
Nothing in it is new.

### 2.1 Active learning in the MAT model

**Exact learning from queries.** Active learning reconstructs a finite
description of an unknown language `L` that is available only through an
interface — a black-box implementation, a simulator, a system too opaque to
open. In Angluin's *minimally adequate teacher* (MAT) model [Ang87] the
interface is two queries: a **membership query** — is the word `w` in
`L`? — answered by a bit, and an **equivalence query** — is the hypothesis
`𝓗` exactly `L`? — answered by *yes* or by a **counterexample**, a word on
which `𝓗` and `L` disagree. The learner chooses its queries adaptively and
must terminate with an exact description of `L`.

**L\* in one paragraph.** For regular languages of finite words the model is
solved by Angluin's L\* [Ang87]. The learner maintains an **observation
table**: rows are access words (prefixes), columns are distinguishing
experiments (suffixes), and the entry at `(u, e)` is the membership bit of
`u·e`. A table that is **closed** (every one-letter extension of a row
matches some row's bit-vector) and **consistent** (rows with equal
bit-vectors have equal one-letter successors) induces a deterministic
automaton on the row classes — the hypothesis. Each counterexample is
processed into a new distinguishing experiment that splits at least one row
class — refinement is *counterexample-guided*, progress arriving exactly when
the hypothesis is caught being wrong; the binary search of Rivest and Schapire
[RS93] finds the split with logarithmically many membership queries. §3 will reuse every one of these
notions, changed only where ω-words force a change.

**Why it converges: a canonical target.** The bookkeeping above is not what
makes L\* work; the Myhill–Nerode theorem is. The right congruence
`u ~_L v ⟺ (∀y: u·y ∈ L ⟺ v·y ∈ L)` of a regular language has finitely many
classes, and its quotient *is* the minimal DFA — a **canonical object**, a
function of `L` and not of any machine presenting it. Canonicity is
load-bearing three times over. It is the progress measure: every split is
witnessed by a genuine `~_L`-separation, so the class count is bounded by
the target's size and each counterexample makes irreversible progress. It
makes complexity meaningful: queries are counted against the size of the
language's own invariant — *output-polynomial* — not against whichever
automaton the teacher happens to hold. And it makes the result usable:
questions about `L` are answered on the learned object itself. On this
view, active learning *is* the reconstruction of a canonical invariant
through queries, and the table is its bookkeeping.

**What survives at ω, and what breaks.** For ω-regular languages the query
interface survives intact. Infinite words cannot be typed into a teacher,
but the **lassos** — ultimately-periodic words `u·v^ω`, finite objects —
determine an ω-regular language completely (§2.2), so membership queries
are posed on lassos and counterexamples are returned as lassos; this has
been the standard move since [MP95, FCC+08, AF16]. What breaks is the
target. Myhill–Nerode fails at ω: the right congruence of an ω-regular `L`
can be trivial while `L` is complex [AF21], so there is no minimal
deterministic acceptor to converge to — and the history of ω-learning (§7)
is a history of substitute targets: a subclass where the right congruence
happens to suffice [MP95], encodings into finite words [FCC+08], families
of DFAs in three competing normal forms [AF16, ABF18]. All are acceptors;
none is a canonical object of `L` alone. This paper keeps the L\* view and
changes the target: the canonical object an ω-regular language actually
owns is the quotient of Arnold's syntactic congruence, materialized as the
invariant `𝓘(L)` — recalled next — and §§3–5 supply what was missing, a
query-level route to a *two-sided* congruence.

**Conventions.** One lasso membership query counts as one query; equivalence
queries are counted separately; all bounds are stated against the size of
the canonical target.


### 2.2 The syntactic ω-semigroup, and its invariant

Everything in this subsection is prior work — the congruence is Arnold's
[Arn85], its algebraic packaging Wilke's and Perrin–Pin's [Wil93, PP04], and
its materialization as the computable invariant `𝓘(L)`, whose notation and
results this paper adopts wholesale, is [SωS26] — restated in the exact form
the learner consumes.

**Lassos.** `Σ` is a finite alphabet (for temporal-logic applications,
`Σ = 2^AP`). A **lasso** is an ultimately-periodic word `u·v^ω`: a finite stem
`u`, a finite non-empty loop `v` repeated forever. Two ω-regular languages are
equal iff they agree on all lassos [PP04], so lassos are the only infinite
words that
ever need to be mentioned: every query below is one, and "the language" means
its lasso membership function.

**The congruence.** Fix an ω-regular `L ⊆ Σ^ω`. Two finite words are
**syntactically congruent**, `u ≈_L v`, when swapping one for the other never
changes membership; Arnold matches the swap positions to the anatomy of a
lasso — the swapped factor sits in the stem, or recurs inside the loop —
giving two context shapes [Arn85; SωS26, Def 3.5]:

```
    (linear)    ∀ x, y ∈ Σ*, t ∈ Σ⁺ :   x·u·y·t^ω ∈ L  ⟺  x·v·y·t^ω ∈ L
    (ω-power)   ∀ x, y ∈ Σ*         :   x·(u·y)^ω  ∈ L  ⟺  x·(v·y)^ω  ∈ L
```

For ω-regular `L` the congruence has **finitely many classes** [Arn85], and
its quotient, completed by the verdicts on lassos, is the **syntactic
ω-semigroup** of `L`: the exact ω-analogue of the syntactic monoid, a
function of `L` alone. The abstract algebra is two-sorted — classes of
finite words, classes of ω-words [PP04] — but on a finite carrier the second
sort is determined by the first and need not be carried [SωS26, §2]; what
this paper computes with, end to end, is the one-sorted *representation*
assembled next.

**The stamp.** The vocabulary that materializes quotients of `Σ⁺` is the
**stamp** [SωS26, Def 3.1]: a surjective semigroup morphism `𝒮 : Σ⁺ → 𝒞`
onto a finite semigroup whose elements are the **classes**, written `[u]` —
and a two-sided congruence supports exactly one: the class of a
concatenation is a function of the classes, `[u]·[v] := [u·v]` well defined.
A stamp is finitely presented by `(𝒞, λ, ·)` — the classes, the **letter
map** `λ := 𝒮|_Σ`, the multiplication table — and evaluating `𝒮` is one
table lookup per letter. It extends to all finite words by adjoining a
**fresh** identity: `M := 𝒞 ∪ {[ε]}`, `𝒮(ε) := [ε]`, making `𝒮 : Σ* → M` a
surjective monoid morphism. Freshness — `[ε]` never identified with the
class of a non-empty word — holds even when `𝒞` owns a neutral element of
its own, which happens: in `Even` below, `[aa]` multiplies as the identity
on every word class. The fresh unit costs one redundant class and buys a
guarantee the learner leans on throughout: every class other than `[ε]`
consists of non-empty words, so it carries a non-empty shortlex key, and
every representative lasso built from keys (§3) has a non-empty loop.
Canonicity is unaffected: the adjunction is a function of `L` alone
[SωS26, §3.1].

**Linked pairs name lassos.** Iterate a class: the powers `c, c², c³, …`
move in a finite semigroup, so they eventually cycle, and exactly one power
is **idempotent**; a single **exponent** `π ≥ 1` with `c^π` idempotent for
every class exists (any common multiple serves, e.g. `|𝒞|!`), and we write
`c^π` [SωS26, Def 3.2]. A **linked pair** is
a pair of classes `(s, e)` with `e·e = e` and `s·e = s`, both classes of
non-empty words — the basepoint `[ε]` appears in no pair; folding a lasso
`u·v^ω` as `(u·v^π)·(v^π)^ω` lands on one — `e = 𝒮(v)^π`, `s = 𝒮(u)·e` — and
membership of the lasso depends *only* on that pair [PP04]. So the
acceptance datum of the algebra is a set of accepting pairs, not a set of
accepting classes: loops are named separately from stems.

**The invariant.** An **invariant** is `𝓘 = ⟨𝒮, P⟩`: a stamp together with a
**pair set** `P` of linked pairs [SωS26, Def 3.3]. It decides lassos with
its own data and nothing else — **lasso membership** [SωS26, Def 3.4]: for a
presentation `(u, v)` of `w = u·v^ω`, set `e := 𝒮(v)^π`, `s := 𝒮(u)·e`; then
`w ∈ L(𝓘)` iff `(s, e) ∈ P`. The queried pair **names** the lasso, and a
lasso bears several names — already `(u, v)` and `(u·v, v)` may land on
distinct pairs. The **syntactic invariant** of `L` is
`𝓘(L) := ⟨𝒮_L, P(L)⟩` — the quotient stamp `𝒮_L : Σ⁺ → 𝒞_L := Σ⁺/≈_L`,
with the pair set collecting the names of all accepted lassos
[SωS26, Def 3.6]: the material representation of the syntactic ω-semigroup,
and the learner's target. Canonicity [SωS26, Thm I]: on `𝓘(L)`, lasso
membership is membership in `L` itself, on every presentation of every
lasso; and `𝓘` is a **complete invariant** — two ω-regular languages over
the same alphabet are equal iff a (unique) isomorphism matches their
invariants, and, with each class keyed by its shortlex-least member
(shortlex throughout this paper uses the letter order of the
serialization — valuation bitvectors ascending, so `!a < a` in the
examples), iff the serialized invariants are byte-identical. The target
answers definability directly: `L` is LTL-expressible iff no power sequence
`c, c², c³, …` cycles with period `> 1` — the aperiodicity read-off
[SωS26, Thm 6.1]. Throughout, `N` counts the classes of the target
*including* the adjoined identity — `N = |𝒞_L| + 1`, the `classes:` line of
the serialized file [SωS26, §6.2] — so class counts here match the
serialization.

**Well-formed and denoting invariants.** Two notions from [SωS26, §4]
organize everything downstream. An invariant **denotes** `L` when every
presentation of every lasso receives `L`'s verdict from lasso membership
[SωS26, Def 4.1]. An invariant is **well-formed** when its pair set is
saturated under conjugacy of linked pairs — the equivalence generated by the
rotation steps `(s, (cd)^π) ∼ (s·c, (dc)^π)` [SωS26, Def 4.2].
Well-formedness is exactly the law that gives every lasso one verdict
through all its presentations, and a well-formed invariant denotes exactly
one language, its own [SωS26, Prop 4.1]. The fact this paper leans on
hardest is [SωS26, Cor 4.2]: **an invariant denoting `L` exists exactly at
the stamps whose kernel refines `≈_L`, and over each such stamp the pair set
is forced** — the names of the accepted lassos, nothing else. Coarser than
the syntactic stamp, no invariant denotes `L` at all. §5 turns this into the
learner's canonicity argument, and §4.2's permanent stall is the phenomenon
it forbids, observed from below.

**The rotation lemma, and the membership tests.** The computational heart of
[SωS26] is a **rotation lemma** [SωS26, Lem 4.1]: a factor carried from a
loop's front onto the stem leaves the ω-word unchanged —
`x·(u·y)^ω = x·u·(y·u)^ω` — so on classes `(s·c, (dc)^π)` names the same
lasso as `(s, (cd)^π)`: a left extension of a loop is a rotation of it, a
right extension read at a shifted starting slot. The construction draws two
services from the lemma, and both transport to the query model (§4). The
first forces the conjugacy closure above: a pair set cannot help being
saturated when it speaks the truth about a language. The second makes the
two-sided congruence right-computable: [SωS26, Def 4.3] poses to each class
`c` the **membership tests**

```
    Λ(d, f)(c) = [ (d·c·f, f) ∈ P ]        Ω(d)(c) = [ (d·c^π, c^π) ∈ P ]
```

— one lasso membership each, the slot `d` ranging over the finitely many
elements of `M` — and agreement under all tests at all right extensions *is*
`≈_L` [SωS26, Lem 4.2]; that this agreement is left-invariant is the
rotation lemma again — a left factor shifts a linear test's slot and
*rotates* an ω test's loop, carrying no information of its own
[SωS26, Lem 4.3]. §3's columns are these tests sampled at word level; §4.3's
sweep is Lemma 4.3 enforced on a table the learner can only probe by
queries. ([SωS26, Thm II] packages the second service on the construction
side — canonicalization by partition refinement — but nothing below depends
on it: the learner's proofs consume Theorem I and Corollary 4.2 only.)


### 2.3 The running examples, and the teacher

For the reader who wants to check every
bit below by hand, here are the running examples — descriptions and automata
reproduced from [SωS26]:

- **`GF(aa) := GF(a ∧ Xa)`** — "infinitely many `aa`-factors." It *is* LTL, but a
  natural presentation encodes the letter `a` as a transposition, so its transition
  monoid carries a spurious group. The SωS *destroys* that group.
- **`Even := (aa)*·!a·Σ^ω`** — over the single atom `a`, an even number of `a`'s then a
  `!a` then anything; in PSL, the words with a prefix matching the SERE
  `{a[*2]}[*] ; !a`. The canonical mod-2 language; *not* LTL, its group genuine, and —
  because a prefix fixes the parity — refuted by Arnold's *linear* (first) shape.
- **`EvenBlocks`** — "infinitely many `!a`'s, and eventually every completed `a`-block
  has even length"; the same `{a[*2]}` even-block SERE, now recurring. Also *not* LTL
  with a genuine mod-2 group, but *prefix-independent*: no finite prefix changes
  membership, so its group is invisible to the linear shape and only Arnold's
  *ω-power* (second) shape can witness it. This is the example that keeps both shapes
  honest.

running examples, reproduced from [SωS26]. Reading key: vertices are the
classes, named by their shortlex keys; following an edge multiplies on the
right by its label; the entry arrows give the letter map `λ`; the accepting
pairs `P` are listed beneath the drawing, and a label `𝒞` abbreviates a
self-loop carrying every class. These drawings are the paper's answer key:
the learner reconstructs each of them, byte for byte, from lasso queries
alone — the automata of Figure 1 stay on the teacher's side of the wall.

**The stall specimens.** Two more examples run against the grain of the three
above, and were *searched for* rather than chosen: the smallest languages, by
class count, that we could find — by exhaustive enumeration of the smallest
automaton shapes — on which a learner without the saturation sweep of §4.3
fails *permanently*. Both are two-letter LTL formulas, simpler than the
classical trivial-right-congruence example `FG(a ∨ Xa)` [AF21]:

- **`a → Xa`** — if the first letter is `a`, so is the second. A safety
  language, LTL-definable; `N = 5`, and its algebra carries *two* accepting
  idempotents, `[!a]` and `[aa]` — right-indistinguishable, separated only by
  the left context `a`, and that is the trap (§4.2).
- **`a ∧ XG¬a`** — the language of the single ω-word `a·(!a)^ω`;
  `N = 4`. The same trap one step deeper: the canonical `[!a·a]` is separated
  from `[!a]` only from the left.

**Figure 3.** The stall specimens: teacher automata (top) and target
invariants (bottom), drawn with Figure 2's conventions (the drawings write
`b` for `!a`, the figure pool's lettering). §4.2 proves the saturation-free
learner stops one class short of each target, certified by an exact oracle.

**The query model, instantiated.** The MAT teacher of §2.1, for this paper:
membership queries are lassos (`u·v^ω ∈ L`?); equivalence queries take a
hypothesis `𝓗` (an invariant-shaped tuple, §3) and return a lasso
counterexample on failure. The restriction to ultimately-periodic words costs
nothing — lassos determine `L` (§2.2) — and every query the algorithm ever
poses is one.

In our experiments the teacher is built on the construction of [SωS26]:
membership is one deterministic run, and an equivalence query is decided
*exactly*, against the language's own invariant `𝓘(L)` — constructed once,
after which the automaton leaves the equivalence loop. The realization — an
align-and-scan of the hypothesis against `𝓘(L)`, with a functionality guard
and a fallback — is detailed with the experimental protocol (§6.1); two of
its properties are used before then. The returned counterexample is the
globally *minimal* one (shortest stem, then shortest loop, then shortlex) —
which makes runs deterministic and the worked examples reproducible; §6
measures what non-minimal policies cost. And nothing in the learner's
correctness depends on this realization.


## 3. The observation table

**Definition 3.1 (table).** A table is `T = (R, E_lin, E_ω)` where `R ⊆ Σ*` is a
finite set of **rows** containing `ε` and `Σ`, observed together with its
frontier `R·Σ`, and the columns are of two sorts:

- `E_lin ⊆ Σ* × Σ* × Σ⁺` — **linear columns**; the entry of row `u` at
  `(x, y, t)` is the bit `[ x·u·y·t^ω ∈ L ]`;
- `E_ω ⊆ Σ* × Σ*` — **ω-columns**; the entry of row `u` at `(x, y)` is the bit
  `[ x·(u·y)^ω ∈ L ]`.

Rows `u, v` are **table-equivalent**, `u ≡_T v`, when all entries agree.

Every entry is one membership query. By construction `≈_L` refines `≡_T` for any
column set — columns are particular Arnold contexts — so learning is the business
of growing `E_lin ∪ E_ω` until `≡_T` *is* `≈_L` on the rows, and growing `R` until
the rows exhaust `𝒞_L`. In the vocabulary of §2.2, the columns are the
membership tests of [SωS26, Def 4.3] sampled at word level — a linear column
`(x, y, t)` reads `Λ(𝒮_L(x), 𝒮_L(t)^π)` at the right extension `𝒮_L(y)`, an
ω-column `(x, y)` reads `Ω(𝒮_L(x))` — except that the learner owns no stamp:
its slots and extensions are concrete words it has queried, and
[SωS26, Lem 4.2] is the guarantee that some finite family of such tests
characterizes `≈_L`.

The two sorts divide the labor exactly as Arnold's two shapes do. On `Even`,
linear columns already separate everything —
the stem decides membership. On `EvenBlocks`, *every* linear column is a constant
row-function (prefix-independence: a stem mutation is swallowed), and the entire
language lives in the ω-sort: the column `(ε, !a)` separates rows `a` and `aa`,
since `(a·!a)^ω ∉ L` and `(aa·!a)^ω ∈ L`. A learner without the ω-sort cannot even
represent what distinguishes them — this is [AF21]'s obstruction, met head-on.
(§4.1 shows the learner *finding* a rotated cousin, `(a, a)`, unaided — and the
final sweep mints `(ε, !a)` itself, Table 8.)

*Example (day one, on `Even`).* `Even = (aa)*·!a·Σ^ω` over `Σ = {a, !a}` — an
even block of `a`, then `!a`, then anything; membership of any word is fixed by
the parity of the `a`-count before its first `!a`. Initialize `R = {ε, a, !a}`,
`E_ω = {(ε, ε)}`, `E_lin = ∅`; Table 1 is the whole state of knowledge.
`a` and `!a` split at once, and every frontier word folds into one of them by
its single bit. Two of these merges are quietly wrong — `aa ≉_L a` (alive with
opposite parity) and `a·!a ≉_L a` (`a·!a` is doomed: its first `!a` closed an
odd block) — and the single column cannot see either. The run below catches
both, by two different mechanisms (§4.1, §4.3).

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | class |
|---|:--:|---|
| `ε` | — | `[ε]` |
| `a` | `0` | `[a]` |
| `!a` | `1` | `[!a]` |
| *frontier:* | | |
| `a·a` | `0` | → `[a]` ✗ |
| `a·!a` | `0` | → `[a]` ✗ |
| `!a·a` | `1` | → `[!a]` |
| `!a·!a` | `1` | → `[!a]` |

**Table 1.** Day one on `Even`: rows above the frontier line, one ω-column
(the entry of word `p` is `[p^ω ∈ L]`), `→` the class each frontier word folds
into. The two merges marked `✗` are wrong (`≉_L`) but invisible: no observed
context separates the words yet.

**Definition 3.2 (closed, consistent; access words; minting).** The table is
observed on its
**words** `W(T) = R ∪ R·Σ` (rows and frontier). `T` is **closed** when every
frontier word is `≡_T` to some row (else the offending frontier word is promoted
to `R`), and **consistent** when `u ≡_T v` implies `u·a ≡_T v·a` for all rows
`u, v` and letters `a` — §2.1's notions, with two sorts of experiments in
place of suffixes. Rows are maintained as **access words**: `R` starts as
`{ε} ∪ Σ`, and every later row is a promoted frontier word `w_c·a`, where
the **representative** `rep(c)` of a class, written `w_c`, is its
shortlex-least row. Two structural facts follow and are used below: every
letter-prefix of a row is itself a row (rows are only ever created by
extending a row with one letter), and each promotion adds one letter to an
existing row while creating a new class, so rows — hence representatives —
have length `O(|𝒞_T|)`. A consistency violation at column `c` **mints** a new
column by migrating the letter into the column: for `c = (x, y, t)` linear, the
column `(x, a·y, t)`; for `c = (x, y)` ω, the column `(x, a·y)`. Minting is sound
bookkeeping — the entry of `u` at the minted column *is* the entry of `u·a` at
`c`, by the identities `x·u·(a·y)·t^ω = x·(u·a)·y·t^ω` and
`x·(u·(a·y))^ω = x·((u·a)·y)^ω` — so the minted column separates `u` from `v`
exactly because `c` separated their `a`-successors. The empty word is kept as a
permanent row for the adjoined identity `[ε]` (it seeds folds and is never
compared), matching the fresh-identity convention of the target (§2.2).

**Lemma 3.3 (coherence).** On a closed and consistent table, the transition
`step(c, a) := class of w_c·a` is well defined and agrees on every member of
`c` — for any row `u` of class `c`, the table word `u·a` has class
`step(c, a)`. Consequently the letterwise **fold**
`ψ(u) := step(…step([ε], u₁)…, u_n)` satisfies `ψ(u) = [u]_{≡_T}` for every
table word `u`, and `≡_T` is a right congruence on rows.

*Proof.* *Well-definedness:* `w_c·a` is a table word (a row, or a frontier
word), and closedness assigns every table word the class of some row.
*Agreement:* for a row `u` of class `c` we have `u ≡_T w_c`, both rows, so
consistency gives `u·a ≡_T w_c·a`, i.e. `class(u·a) = step(c, a)`.
*Coherence*, by induction on `|u|` over table words. Base: `ψ(ε) = [ε]` by
definition. Step: every non-empty table word is `u = p·a` with `p` a row —
a frontier word extends a row by definition, and a non-empty row was created
as a one-letter extension of a row (Definition 3.2's access discipline) — and
`p`, a shorter table word, is covered by the induction hypothesis:
`ψ(u) = step(ψ(p), a) = step([p], a) = class(p·a) = [u]`, the third equality
by agreement. *Right congruence:* for rows `u ≡_T v` and a letter `a`,
agreement twice gives `[u·a] = step([u], a) = step([v], a) = [v·a]`. ∎

More generally, write `fold(d, u)` for the letterwise `step`-walk on `u`
started at an arbitrary class `d`, so that `ψ(u) = fold([ε], u)`. Folds compose
over *literal* concatenation — `ψ(x·y) = fold(ψ(x), y)`, immediately from the
definition — a small identity used repeatedly below; note that it concatenates
*words*, not classes: nothing yet says `fold(d, u)` and `fold(d, w_{ψ(u)})`
agree, and §4.2 turns exactly on that gap.

**The hypothesis, in Cayley form.** A closed, consistent table presents the
hypothesis `𝓗 = (𝒞_T, λ, step, P)`: the table's class set (written `𝒞_T`, to
keep it apart from the target's `𝒞_L`), `λ(a) = ψ(a)`, the transition
function `step` — a deterministic automaton *on classes* — and an accepting-pair
cache `P`. No monoid product is computed mid-learning; the multiplication table
is exported only at the end (§5). `P` is a **cache of teacher truths**: on demand,
`P(s, e) := teacher[ w_s·(w_e)^ω ]`, one membership query per pair, memoized —
so `P` is never "wrong," only indexed by classes that may later split.

**Prediction.** For a lasso `w·z^ω`: compute the fold orbit `c_j = ψ(z^j)` (each
step folds the literal `z` once); the orbit is deterministic over `𝒞_T`, so its
index and period are each at most `|𝒞_T|` and there is
`k ≤ 2·|𝒞_T|` with `c_{2k} = c_k` — take the least — and predict with
the pair `s = ψ(w·z^k)`, `e = c_k`:  `𝓗` answers `P(s, e)`. By construction the
prediction *is* the teacher's verdict on the representative lasso
`w_s·(w_e)^ω` — a genuine lasso: no word ever joins the permanent singleton
`[ε]`, so `e ≠ [ε]` and the loop `w_e` is non-empty, §2's fresh-identity
convention earning its keep. That definition is deliberate: a counterexample is therefore
always a pair of concrete lassos — the queried one and its representative
collapse — on which the *teacher's own bits differ*.

*Example (a prediction, and its miss).* We now run the prediction procedure in
slow motion, on `EvenBlocks`: infinitely many `!a`, and eventually every
completed `a`-block has even length — a *block* being a maximal run of `a`,
*completed* when the next `!a` closes it. Day one (Table 2) has the same shape
as `Even`'s: the single ω-column splits `a` from `!a`, and every frontier word
merges by its one bit. One entry deserves a pause: `!a·a` lands with `a` here,
not with `!a` as it did in `Even` — `(!a·a)^ω` completes an odd block forever,
bit `0`. So the hypothesis's worldview is: there are three kinds of finite
words — the empty one, the pure `!a`-blocks, and *everything that has ever
seen an `a`*. Its `step` function says exactly that: from `[!a]`, reading `a`
moves to `[a]`; from `[a]`, no letter ever leaves.

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | class |
|---|:--:|---|
| `ε` | — | `[ε]` |
| `a` | `0` | `[a]` |
| `!a` | `1` | `[!a]` |
| *frontier:* | | |
| `a·a` | `0` | → `[a]` |
| `a·!a` | `0` | → `[a]` |
| `!a·a` | `0` | → `[a]`  (≠ `Even`!) |
| `!a·!a` | `1` | → `[!a]` |

**Table 2.** Day one on `EvenBlocks`: same shape as Table 1, one telling
difference — `!a·a` folds to `[a]`, so `[a]` is absorbing and the fold sees
only "have I read an `a` yet".

Now predict the lasso `(ε, !a·aa)`, following the definition step by step.
*Fold the loop:* `ψ(!a·aa)` walks `[ε] →_{!a} [!a] →_a [a] →_a [a]` — the
middle step crossing the telling entry above — so `c_1 = [a]`. *Find the
idempotent power:* `c_2 = ψ((!a·aa)²)` continues the walk from `[a]` —
absorbed, so `c_2 = [a]` — and the least `k` with `c_{2k} = c_k` is `k = 1`:
the hypothesis believes `[a]` is already idempotent. *Form the pair:*
`s = ψ(ε·!a·aa) = [a]`, `e = [a]`. This step is the whole point of a
prediction: the hypothesis has just **named** the queried lasso by the pair
`([a], [a])` — the same name it gives `a·a^ω`, `(a·!a)^ω`, `(!a·a)^ω`, and
every other lasso whose folds collapse into `[a]` — and one name gets one
verdict. *Look up the name:* the cache has no entry for `([a],[a])`, so it
costs one membership query on the shortlex keys,
`w_{[a]}·(w_{[a]})^ω = a·a^ω` — rejected, no `!a` at all. Cached; prediction
`0`.

The miss: `(!a·aa)^ω ∈ L` — infinitely many `!a`, and every completed block it
ever closes is `aa`, length two. The hypothesis gave one name to two lassos
that the language distinguishes, and that is all a counterexample ever is in
this design: the queried lasso and its representative collapse, two concrete
lassos, teacher bits `1` and `0`.

The minimization policy of §2.3 explains why this exact lasso is the one
returned. Enumerating stems shortest-first and loops shortest-then-shortlex
(`!a < a`): `(ε, !a)`, `(ε, a)`, the four two-letter loops, and then
`(ε, !a!a!a)`, `(ε, !a!a·a)`, `(ε, !a·a!a)` are all predicted correctly — each
folds to a name whose representative lasso the language happens to treat the
same way — and `(ε, !a·aa)` is the first place the name `([a],[a])` cracks. A
misprediction is an equality the table wrongly believes; the harvest of §4.1
turns this one into the column that refutes it.


## 4. The learner

### 4.1 The harvest: every disagreeing lasso surrenders a column

Let `w·z^ω` be a lasso on which prediction and teacher disagree. **Normalize**
`(w', z') = (w·z^k, z^k)` with `k` as in the prediction — the same ω-word, now
with `s = ψ(w')`, `e = ψ(z')` the predicting pair. Write `n = |w'|`, `m = |z'|`.
Interpolate between the counterexample and its representative collapse by two
chains of teacher bits, each replacing a growing prefix by its class
representative:

```
    stem chain:   γ_i = [ rep(ψ(w'[1..i])) · w'[i+1..n] · z'^ω ∈ L ]      i = 0..n
    loop chain:   δ_i = [ w_s · ( rep(ψ(z'[1..i])) · z'[i+1..m] )^ω ∈ L ]  i = 0..m
```

Then `γ_0 = [w'·z'^ω ∈ L]` is the teacher's bit on the counterexample,
`γ_n = δ_0 = [w_s·z'^ω ∈ L]` is the junction, and `δ_m = [w_s·(w_e)^ω ∈ L]` is
the prediction. The concatenated bit sequence has differing endpoints, so it
flips at an adjacent pair; **one junction query** decides the half, and a
Rivest–Schapire binary search [RS93] — each probe one membership query — finds a
flip in `O(log n)` resp. `O(log m)` queries.

**Lemma 4.1 (stem harvest).** A flip `γ_i ≠ γ_{i+1}` yields the frontier word
`u = rep(ψ(w'[1..i]))·w'[i+1]` and the row `v = rep(ψ(w'[1..i+1]))`, currently
assigned the same class, separated by the **linear column**
`(ε, w'[i+2..n], z')`.

**Lemma 4.2 (loop harvest).** A flip `δ_i ≠ δ_{i+1}` yields the frontier word
`u = rep(ψ(z'[1..i]))·z'[i+1]` and the row `v = rep(ψ(z'[1..i+1]))`, currently
assigned the same class, separated by the **ω-column** `(w_s, z'[i+2..m])`.

*Proof of both.* The two flipped bits are exactly the entries of `u` and `v` at
the stated column — substitute and compare — and the columns are Arnold contexts,
so the separation is genuine: `u ≉_L v`. That `u` and `v` currently share a class
is the definition of `step`. Replacing the prefix *at the head of the loop* and
letting the ω-column's `(x, y)` format carry the rest is the rotation lemma
[SωS26, Lem 4.1] enacted: no search over rotations is ever needed. ∎

**Theorem 4.3 (harvest).** Each counterexample adds the flip column and splits
one class — the frontier word `u` leaves the class of `v` — so `|𝒞_T|` grows by
one per equivalence query, at a cost of `O(log(|w| + |𝒞_T|·|z|))` membership
queries: the normalized lengths are `n ≤ |w| + 2|𝒞_T|·|z|` and
`m ≤ 2|𝒞_T|·|z|`, since the stabilization power satisfies `k ≤ 2|𝒞_T|`.

*Proof.* A flip exists: the concatenated chain runs from the teacher's bit on
the counterexample to the (wrong) prediction, so its endpoints differ, and
the junction bit `γ_n = δ_0` decides which half flips. The flip splits a
class by Lemma 4.1 resp. 4.2: the frontier word `u` differs from the row `v`
on the minted column, so `u` leaves `v`'s class when the table refills. The
cost: the two chains total `n + m` positions with the stated bounds, and one
junction query plus a binary search over a bit sequence with differing
endpoints finds an adjacent flip in the stated logarithm. ∎

*Example (two counterexamples, one wrong name, two shapes).* The two running
specimens' first equivalence queries return different lassos — `Even`'s
teacher hands back `(ε, aa!a)`, `EvenBlocks`'s the shortlex-earlier
`(ε, !a·aa)` — but the same failure: each is predicted `0` through the pair
`([a],[a])`, i.e. through the representative lasso `a·a^ω`, and each is truly
in its language. Normalization is trivial in both (`k = 1`, so `w' = z'` is
the loop itself), the stem representative is `w_s = a` in both, and the
junction query routes them oppositely. On `Even`, `[a·(aa!a)^ω] = 0` — the
prepended `a` flips the parity — against `γ_0 = [(aa!a)^ω] = 1`: the flip is
in the **stem chain**, Table 3(a). On `EvenBlocks`, `[a·(!a·aa)^ω] = 1` — a
prefix cannot harm a prefix-independent language — equal to `γ_0`, so the
stem chain is flat and the flip is in the **loop chain**, Table 3(c). Both
flips sit at position `1 → 2` of their chains, but they convict different
words: from (a), the frontier word `u = rep(ψ(a))·a = aa` against the row
`v = rep(ψ(aa)) = a`, minting the linear column `(ε, !a, aa!a)`, entries `1`
for `aa` and `0` for `a` — the parity merge of day one, split; from (c), the
frontier word `u = rep(ψ(!a))·a = !a·a` against the row
`v = rep(ψ(!a·a)) = a`, minting the ω-column `(a, a)` — a rotated cousin of
the `(ε, !a)` we exhibited in §3, found by the machinery rather than by
inspection. Tables 3(b) and 3(d) show the tables after the split. Two lassos,
one wrong name, Arnold's two shapes: the counterexample analysis is the
two-shape split of the congruence, run backwards.

*(a) `Even`, the stem chain `γ` — replace a growing stem prefix by its rep:*

| `i` | prefix | its rep | queried lasso | `γ_i` |
|:--:|---|:--:|---|:--:|
| 0 | — | — | `aa!a·(aa!a)^ω` | `1` |
| 1 | `a` | `a` | `a·a!a·(aa!a)^ω` | `1` |
| 2 | `aa` | `a` | `a·!a·(aa!a)^ω` | **`0`** |
| 3 | `aa!a` | `a` | `a·(aa!a)^ω` | `0` |

*(b) `Even`, after the stem harvest:*

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | **`(ε, !a, aa!a)_lin`** | class |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| `a` | `0` | **`0`** | `[a]` |
| `!a` | `1` | **`1`** | `[!a]` |
| **`aa`** | `0` | **`1`** | **`[aa]`** |
| *frontier:* | | | |
| `a·!a` | `0` | **`0`** | → `[a]` ✗ still |
| `aa·!a` | `1` | **`1`** | → `[!a]` |

*(c) `EvenBlocks`, the loop chain `δ` — stem pinned to `w_s = a`, replace a
growing loop prefix by its rep:*

| `i` | prefix | its rep | queried lasso | `δ_i` |
|:--:|---|:--:|---|:--:|
| 0 | — | — | `a·(!a·aa)^ω` | `1` |
| 1 | `!a` | `!a` | `a·(!a·aa)^ω` | `1` |
| 2 | `!a·a` | `a` | `a·(a·a)^ω` | **`0`** |
| 3 | `!a·aa` | `a` | `a·(a)^ω` | `0` |

*(d) `EvenBlocks`, after the loop harvest:*

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | **`(a, a)_ω`** | class |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| `a` | `0` | **`0`** | `[a]` |
| `!a` | `1` | **`0`** | `[!a]` |
| **`!a·a`** | `0` | **`1`** | **`[!a·a]`** |

**Table 3.** The two first counterexamples, processed (minted column and
promoted row in bold; `ε`-row and unchanged frontier omitted). In both
chains, row `i = 1` replaces a one-letter prefix by its own representative —
a no-op, bit unchanged — and the flips sit at `1 → 2`. In (a), row 3 is the
junction `γ_3 = δ_0`, already `0`: the stem chain flipped, minting a *linear*
column. In (c) the junction is `1` and the loop chain flips instead, minting
an *ω-column*; note row 3's lasso is `a·a^ω` — the representative lasso of
the predicting pair, i.e. the prediction itself, closing the chain. (a) pulls
`aa` out of `[a]`; (c) pulls `!a·a` out — and in (b) the doomed `a·!a` still
hides in `[a]`, which is §4.3's catch.


### 4.2 The gap: acceptance-correct is not algebra-correct

The harvest reacts to *membership* disagreements — and membership's error signal
is structurally one-sided. Predictions fold the **literal** words of the queried
lasso; they never consult the class of a row *embedded under a left context*. So
if two rows `u, v` with `u ≉_L v` are merged, and no harvested column happens to carry
the separating prefix `x`, nothing observable ever goes wrong: every prediction
is computed from literal prefixes, every lasso verdict can be correct, the
equivalence oracle assents — and the learner stops with a table **coarser than
the syntactic congruence**. The fixpoint object is then a
right-congruence-flavored acceptor: an FDFA in algebraic clothing. This is the obstruction of
[AF21] reborn one level up — the table's *columns* are two-sided, but its *error
signal* is not — and it is, we believe, the true reason no observation-table
route to the syntactic algebra existed: the missing ingredient is not a cleverer
column format, but a repair that lives outside the counterexample loop. Neither running specimen realizes the stall *permanently* — in
both, the wrong merge eventually poisons some prediction, and a later
equivalence query catches it (a transient stall). But the permanent stall is
not a hypothetical, and it does not take an exotic language: an exhaustive
census of the smallest automaton shapes (nondeterministic transition-based
Büchi over one atomic proposition; at one state every fixpoint is
canonical, so two states are the smallest possible) finds it already at
`a → Xa` — the stall specimen of §2.3, automaton and target in Figure 3.

**Proposition 4.4 (the stall, realized).** Let `L = L(a → Xa)` — if the first
letter is `a`, so is the second — over `Σ = {a, !a}`. The saturation-free
learner reaches, before its first equivalence query, a closed and consistent
four-class table — `[ε]`, the singleton `[a]`, a committed-in class
`C₁ = !a·Σ* ∪ aa·Σ*`, a committed-out class `C₀ = a!a·Σ*` — whose hypothesis
language is exactly `L`. Every equivalence oracle therefore assents, bounded
or exact; the fixpoint is strictly coarser than the syntactic congruence —
four classes against `N = 5`: the two accepting idempotents `[!a]` and `[aa]`,
right-indistinguishable but separated by the left context `x = a`, stay merged
inside `C₁` — and the export is broken as an algebra: its multiplication table
is not associative, and its membership read-off is not even
presentation-invariant — it accepts `a^ω` written as the lasso `(ε, a)` and
rejects the same ω-word written `(a, a)`.

*Proof.* Membership of an ω-word depends only on its first two letters, so on
lassos it is a function of the *commitment* of the literal prefix: every word
of `C₁` begins a member, every word of `C₀` begins a non-member, and the only
uncommitted non-empty word is the single letter `a` — the class `[a]` is a
singleton. The four-class partition is closed and consistent (`C₁` and `C₀`
absorb both letters; `a` steps into one or the other), and the learner
provably lands on it: every pre-equivalence column has prefix `x = ε` — the
initial column does, and consistency mints preserve the prefix
(Definition 3.2) — and an `x = ε` context evaluates any word of length ≥ 2 by
its commitment alone, so no such column can split `C₁` or `C₀`; conversely
the inconsistency of `a` against `!a` at `(ε, ε)` (their `!a`-successors'
bits differ) forces the mint `(ε, !a)` that isolates `[a]`. Now take any
lasso `w·z^ω` with predicting pair
`s = ψ(w·z^k)`, `e = ψ(z^k)`. The stem `w·z^k` can never be the word `a`:
either it is longer than one letter, or `w = ε` and `z = a` — and there
`k = 1` fails the stabilization test (`ψ(a) = [a]` but `ψ(aa) = C₁`), so
normalization takes `k = 2` and the stem is `aa`. Hence `s ∈ {C₁, C₀}`
always, and the prediction — the teacher's bit on `w_s·(w_e)^ω`, with
`w_{C₁} = !a` and `w_{C₀} = a!a` — equals the commitment of `s`, which equals
the truth of the queried lasso. No counterexample exists. ∎

The census's second specimen, `a ∧ XG¬a` — the language of the single ω-word
`a·(!a)^ω` — stalls the same way one step deeper, and the same argument
proves it permanent: the canonical `[!a·a]` stays
merged into `[!a]`, again separated only by `x = a`. There the alive class
`{a·!a^m}` squares to the dead class, so the loop idempotent `e` is always
dead, and the stem class `s` stays alive only when the literal `w·z^k` is of
the form `a·!a^m` — which forces a pure-`!a` loop, on which the representative
lasso `a·(!a)^ω` answers correctly; any stray `a` in the loop drags `s` to
dead through the literal fold before the faulty merge can matter — every
predicting pair again answers with the truth, and no counterexample exists.
Two exhibits, one mechanism, and both minimal:

| specimen | `N` | stalled fixpoint | merged pair | separated by | export error (read as `(a, a)`) |
|---|:--:|---|---|:--:|---|
| `a → Xa` | 5 | **4 — zero counterexamples** | `[!a] = [aa]`, both accepting idempotents | `x = a` only | rejects `a^ω` |
| `a ∧ XG¬a` | 4 | 3 — one counterexample | `[!a] = [!a·a]` | `x = a` only | accepts `a^ω` |

"One class short" undersells the defect. Export the stalled fixpoint of
`a → Xa` by §5's recipe, `c·c' := fold(c, rep(c'))`, next to the
canonical algebra of the language:

```

    a      a    a!a  aa   aa   aa          a      a    a!a  !a   !a

    aa     aa   aa   aa   aa   aa
```

(cells name classes by their keys; in the stalled table `[!a]` is the merged
`C₁` and `[a!a]` is `C₀`). The stalled table is **not associative**:
`([a]·[a])·[a] = [!a]·[a] = [!a]`, but `[a]·([a]·[a]) = [a]·[!a] = [a!a]`.
The first bracketing folds the literal word `aaa` and lands where it should;
the second substitutes the merged class's representative `!a` into the middle
of the product — and substituting a representative mid-product is exactly what
a merely-right congruence does not license. The hypothesis is immune, because
it folds the literal letters of the queried lasso and never substitutes — that
is how one partition carries a correct acceptor and a broken algebra at once.
Broken means broken downstream: on a non-associative table the linked-pair
reduction is bracketing-dependent, so the export does not even define a
*language* — its verdict depends on how the lasso is written. On
[SωS26]'s ladder the defect sits below the bottom rung: not associative, the
export is not a stamp, hence not an invariant that could be well-formed or
not [SωS26, Defs 3.1, 4.2] — and its read-off visibly breaks the one law an
invariant's semantics must obey, one lasso one verdict [SωS26, Prop 4.1].
Read `a^ω` as
the lasso `(ε, a)`: `e = [a]² = [!a]`, `s = [ε]·e = [!a]`, the pair
`([!a],[!a])` — accept, agreeing with the teacher. Read the same ω-word as
`(a, a)`: the stem class now multiplies the merged idempotent,
`s = [a]·[!a] = [a!a]`, pair `([a!a],[!a])` — reject. The exhibit table
reports this second reading, the shortlex-least divergence from the teacher.
On the second specimen the same defect points the other way: the canonical
algebra of `a ∧ XG¬a` keeps `[a]·[a] = [!a·a]` as its own non-accepting
idempotent, the stalled export merges it into `[!a]`, and the `(a, a)`
reading of `a^ω` lands on the accepting pair `([a], [!a])` — the bit of
`a·(!a)^ω`, the one word the language contains — while its `(ε, a)` reading
agrees with the teacher: one ω-word, two verdicts, no language.

Both languages are LTL-definable and utterly plain: the flagship stall is a
two-letter implication, on which the saturation-free learner converges and is
certified by a *complete* equivalence oracle. (Mechanically confirmed: the exact oracle of §2.3
certifies both stalled fixpoints — these permanence proofs turn those two runs
into fixtures for the oracle itself, a counterexample there being an oracle bug —
and with saturation on, both reach their canonical algebras, byte-equal to
the reference.) Canonicity is therefore beyond counterexample-guided
refinement: the CEGAR loop that carries L\* — and every ω-learner since — has
no error signal left to react to, and what breaks the stall must be a query
the learner poses on its own initiative. The repair below is that query — not
an optimization but the difference between the algebra and an acceptor. (§5
closes the account: by Theorem 5.3 *every* exactly-certified stall is like
these two — its partition is never a congruence, so there is no algebra on
its classes to mis-export.)


### 4.3 The repair: left-saturation over class representatives

The missing ingredient is the other half of the rotation lemma (§2.2): a left
factor acts only by re-indexing a slot, and slots are finitely many
[SωS26, Lem 4.3]; on the
learner's side, left contexts need range only over **class representatives**. Augment the loop with a **left-saturation sweep**: for every
table word `u` with class representative `v = rep(ψ(u))`, `u ≠ v`, and every
class `d` with representative `r = rep(d)`,

```
    check   fold(d, u) = fold(d, v)          (a pure table computation — zero queries)
```

**Lemma 4.5 (saturation progress).** If `fold(d, u) =: c_a ≠ c_b := fold(d, v)`,
then two membership queries and at most one frozen-prefix binary search yield a
new separating column and a class split.

*Proof.* Since `c_a ≠ c_b`, some existing column `κ` separates their
representatives — distinct classes differ on some column, by definition of
`≡_T`; say `κ = (x°, y°, t°)` linear, so the table already holds
`[x°·w_{c_a}·y°·t°^ω] ≠ [x°·w_{c_b}·y°·t°^ω]` (for the ω-sort `κ = (x°, y°)`,
read `[x°·(w_{c}·y°)^ω]` throughout). Query the two words under the same
context: `A = [x°·r·u·y°·t°^ω]`, `B = [x°·r·v·y°·t°^ω]` (ω-sort:
`A = [x°·(r·u·y°)^ω]`, `B = [x°·(r·v·y°)^ω]`).
- If `A ≠ B`: mint the column that reproduces "`r·w` under `κ`" as a bit on
  the bare candidate `w` — and the two sorts here differ. For a *linear* `κ`
  the candidate sits in the finite prefix, so `r` prepends there:
  `(x°·r, y°, t°)`. For an *ω* `κ` the candidate rides in the period, and
  peeling one `r` off the repeating block gives
  `x°·(r·w·y°)^ω = x°·r·(w·y°·r)^ω`: `r` must seed *both* the prefix and the
  period's tail — `(x°·r, y°·r)`. (The bare-prefix form `(x°·r, y°)` keeps
  the period `w·y°` unchanged and need not separate at all: for a
  prefix-independent `L` its added prefix is vacuous outright,
  Proposition 4.6.) Either way the minted column
  separates `u` from `v` directly — a genuine Arnold context — splitting
  their shared class.
- If `A = B`: the bits `A, B` cannot both agree with the two differing
  representative bits; say `A ≠ [x°·w_{c_a}·y°·t°^ω]`, where
  `c_a = fold(d, u) = fold(ψ(r), u) = ψ(r·u)` — folds composing over the
  literal concatenation `r·u`. So the word `r·u` and its own class
  representative behave differently under `x°·_·y°·t°^ω`. Run the stem
  chain of §4.1 on the segment `r·u` with the prefix `x°` **frozen** in place:
  `γ''_j = [ x° · rep(ψ((r·u)[1..j])) · (r·u)[j+1..] · y°·t°^ω ]`, from
  `γ''_0 = A` to `γ''_{|ru|} = [x°·w_{c_a}·y°·t°^ω] ≠ A`. The flip exists,
  binary search finds it, and Lemma 4.1's argument applies verbatim with `x°`
  frozen: the flip at position `j` separates the frontier word
  `rep(ψ((r·u)[1..j]))·(r·u)[j+1]` from the row `rep(ψ((r·u)[1..j+1]))` by the
  column `(x°, (r·u)[j+2..]·y°, t°)` — the prefix is `x°` alone, the unconsumed
  segment migrating into the middle component. Either way one class splits. ∎

*Remark (the ω-mint's shape matters).* Implemented with the bare-prefix form
`(x°·r, y°)`, the sweep on `GF(aa)` — prefix-independent, so the added prefix
is swallowed — separates nothing and never converges; only the reseeded
period of `(x°·r, y°·r)` carries `r`'s left action into the loop.

*Example (a saturation sweep on `Even`, in full).* Resume `Even` after §4.1's
split: four classes `[ε], [a], [!a], [aa]`, with `a·!a` still merged into
`[a]` — the doomed word still passing for an alive one. The sweep's subjects
are the five table words that are not class representatives; against the four
classes `d`, that is twenty checks, each a pure fold computation. Table 4 is
the *entire* sweep — zero membership queries on this page. (The scan order is
pinned, for reproducible traces: subjects in shortlex order, classes in key
order; a different order changes which cell fires first — never the
fixpoint.)

| `u` (vs `v = rep`) | `d = [ε]` | `d = [!a]` | `d = [a]` | `d = [aa]` |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `!a·!a` (vs `!a`) | `[!a]` | `[!a]` | `[a]` | `[!a]` |
| `!a·a` (vs `!a`) | `[!a]` | `[!a]` | **`[aa]` ≠ `[a]`** | `[!a]` |
| `a·!a` (vs `a`) | `[a]` | `[!a]` | **`[!a]` ≠ `[aa]`** | `[a]` |
| `aa·!a` (vs `!a`) | `[!a]` | `[!a]` | `[a]` | `[!a]` |
| `aa·a` (vs `a`) | `[a]` | `[!a]` | `[aa]` | `[a]` |

**Table 4.** The left-saturation sweep on `Even`'s four-class table: cell
`(u, d)` compares `fold(d, u)` against `fold(d, rep(ψ(u)))`; a single value
means they agree. Twenty checks, zero queries, two hits — both at `d = [a]`,
both symptoms of the one wrong merge. In scan order the first to fire is
`(!a·a, [a])`.

Escalate the fired cell (Lemma 4.5): `u = !a·a`, `v = !a`, `d = [a]`,
`r = a`, diverging folds `c_a = fold([a], !a·a) = [aa]` and
`c_b = fold([a], !a) = [a]`. Pause on what fired: `!a·a` is *correctly*
merged with `!a` — the divergence arises because its fold from `[a]` walks
through the wrong merge, not because the subject is misplaced. The escalation
convicts the guilty word anyway. The column separating `rep([aa]) = aa` from
`rep([a]) = a` is the harvested `κ = (ε, !a, aa!a)`, and the two probe
queries — the escalation's only queries — are

```
    A = [ a·!a·a ·!a·(aa!a)^ω ] = 0        (r·u under κ's context)
    B = [ a·!a   ·!a·(aa!a)^ω ] = 0        (r·v under κ's context)
```

`A = B`: the first branch yields nothing, so we are in the second. Which side
disagrees with its own fold class? `ψ(r·u) = c_a = [aa]`, whose
representative `aa` holds κ-bit `1 ≠ A` — the `u`-side. Run the frozen-prefix
chain on the segment `r·u = a·!a·a` inside κ's context (here `x° = ε`, so the
freeze is invisible; a genuinely frozen prefix arises when κ carries one):

| `j` | prefix of `a·!a·a` | its rep | queried lasso | bit |
|:--:|---|:--:|---|:--:|
| 0 | — | — | `a!aa·!a·(aa!a)^ω` | `0` |
| 1 | `a` | `a` | `a·!aa·!a·(aa!a)^ω` | `0` |
| 2 | `a·!a` | `a` | `a·a·!a·(aa!a)^ω` | **`1`** |
| 3 | `a·!a·a` | `aa` | `aa·!a·(aa!a)^ω` | `1` |

**Table 5.** The escalation's chain: replace a growing prefix of `a·!a·a` by
its class representative, query under κ's context. The flip at `j = 1 → 2`
hands over the frontier word `a·!a` (that is, `rep(ψ(a))·!a`) and the row `a`
(that is, `rep(ψ(a·!a))`), separated by the minted **linear column
`(ε, a!a, aa!a)`** — entries `0` for `a·!a`, `1` for `a`. The doomed word
leaves `[a]`.

Two membership bits and a two-probe chain did the work of an equivalence
round: this merge was transient (the very next equivalence query would have
returned `(ε, a!a)`), but the sweep neither knew nor needed to know that —
and §4.2's permanent stall is caught by nothing else. One
remark completes the picture: the *other* hit, `(a·!a, [a])`, escalates
through the **first** branch — there `c_a = [!a]`, `c_b = [aa]`, the
separating column is the original ω-column `κ = (ε, ε)`, and the probes
`A = [(a·a!a)^ω] = 1 ≠ 0 = [(a·a)^ω] = B` differ, minting the ω-column
`(a, a)` directly — the left factor absorbed into the prefix *and* reseeded
at the period's tail, branch 1's ω-form in action. Same
split, other arm: one four-class table exercises both branches of Lemma 4.5,
and the fixpoint is the same five classes either way — only the *trace*
needs the pinned order. Table 6 shows the resulting table, which is final.

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | `(ε,!a,aa!a)_lin` | **`(ε,a!a,aa!a)_lin`** | class |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| `a` | `0` | `0` | **`1`** | `[a]` |
| `!a` | `1` | `1` | **`1`** | `[!a]` |
| `aa` | `0` | `1` | **`0`** | `[aa]` |
| **`a·!a`** | `0` | `0` | **`0`** | **`[a!a]`** |

**Table 6.** `Even` at the fixpoint (saturated column and promoted row in
bold; `ε`-row omitted). The four bit-signatures are pairwise distinct — with
`[ε]`, the `N = 5` classes of `𝓘(Even)` — and every frontier word now folds
cleanly: `a·!a·a` carries the all-zero signature of the absorbing reject and
joins `[a!a]`; `aa·!a` carries the all-one signature of the committed accept
and joins `[!a]`.

Saturation checks are free; escalations are bounded by the total number of
splits. The sweep runs after closedness and consistency, before each equivalence
query; a clean sweep certifies that `ψ`'s kernel is a **left** congruence on
table words — and it was a right congruence by Lemma 3.3.

The left contexts the sweep enforces come in Arnold's two shapes, and
prefix-independence silences exactly one of them:

**Proposition 4.6 (prefix-independence and the two shapes).** Let `L` be
prefix-independent (`w ∈ L ⟺ σ·w ∈ L` for every finite `σ`). Then the prefix
slot `x` of every Arnold context is vacuous — `x·u·y·t^ω ∈ L ⟺ u·y·t^ω ∈ L`
and `x·(u·y)^ω ∈ L ⟺ (u·y)^ω ∈ L` — so the *linear* shape degenerates to pure
right extensions: a linear context separates `u` from `v` iff one with `x = ε`
does. The *ω-power* shape does not degenerate: in `(u·y)^ω` every occurrence
of `u` after the first is preceded by `y`, so the context acts on `u` from the
left through the wrap-around — a left action that is a rotation of the loop,
not a deletable prefix.

*Proof.* The vacuity of `x` is prefix-independence applied to the finite
prefix `x`. For the wrap-around: `(u·y)^ω = u·(y·u)^ω`, so by
prefix-independence `(u·y)^ω ∈ L ⟺ (y·u)^ω ∈ L` — the membership constraint
on `u` under the ω-context `(_·y)^ω` is exactly its behavior under the left
factor `y`, read as a rotation (§2.2), which deleting finite prefixes never
touches. ∎

**Corollary 4.7 (a prefix-independent gap is ω-sorted).** Let `L` be
prefix-independent. (a) `u ≈_L v` iff `u` and `v` agree under every pure
right extension (`u·y·t^ω ∈ L ⟺ v·y·t^ω ∈ L` for all `y ∈ Σ*, t ∈ Σ⁺` —
that is, `u ~_L v`, the right congruence) *and* under every bare ω-power
(`(u·y)^ω ∈ L ⟺ (v·y)^ω ∈ L` for all `y ∈ Σ*`). Consequently two words the
right congruence identifies but `≈_L` separates are separated by ω-power
contexts *only*. (b) On the learner's side the sort discipline is absolute:
every column of every run on `L` is of the ω-sort.

*Proof.* (a) By Proposition 4.6 the prefix `x` is vacuous in both shapes.
The linear shape's remaining contexts `y·t^ω` range over the lassos of the
residual languages, which are ω-regular and hence determined by them [PP04] —
agreement under all of them is exactly `u ~_L v` — and the ω-power shape's
remaining contexts are the bare ω-powers. If `u ~_L v` and `u ≉_L v`, the
separating Arnold context is therefore of the ω-power shape. (b) By
induction over the run. The initial column is the ω-column `(ε, ε)`, and
every mint inherits the sort of the column it derives from: consistency
mints by Definition 3.2, both saturation branches by Lemma 4.5 (branch 1
reproduces `κ` in `κ`'s own sort; branch 2's frozen chain mints `κ`'s sort,
the segment migrating into the middle component). The only source of a
linear column left is the harvest's stem chain (Lemma 4.1) — and on a
prefix-independent language the stem chain is *flat*: its bits `γ_i` belong
to words that differ only in their finite prefixes, so `γ_0 = ⋯ = γ_n`,
every flip lands in the loop chain, and Lemma 4.2 mints an ω-column. ∎

Table 8's run is the corollary performed — four columns, all ω — and §6.3
uses it in the other direction, as a certificate: a permanent stall of a
prefix-independent language must be recovered entirely by ω-sort mints, a
machine-checkable signature of every such census witness.

Prefix-independence also has a floor, which bounds where such witnesses
can live at all:

**Lemma 4.8 (prefix-independence needs depth).** A prefix-independent
language that is topologically closed — a safety language — is `∅` or
`Σ^ω`; dually for open. A nontrivial prefix-independent language is
therefore neither closed nor open.

*Proof.* Let `L` be closed, prefix-independent, and nonempty, and pick
`w ∈ L`. Every `x ∈ Σ^ω` is the limit of the words `x[0..n]·w`, each in
`L` by prefix-independence; closedness puts the limit in `L`, so
`L = Σ^ω`. An open prefix-independent language has a closed
prefix-independent complement. ∎

**The loop, assembled.**

```
    R ← {ε} ∪ Σ;   E_ω ← {(ε, ε)};   E_lin ← ∅;   P ← ∅
    repeat:
        fill entries (membership queries)
        repair closedness (promote) and consistency (mint) to fixpoint
        left-saturation sweep; on escalation (Lemma 4.5): split, restart loop
        pose EQ(𝓗 = (𝒞_T, λ, step, P))
        if yes: export 𝓘 (§5) and stop
        else: normalize the counterexample; junction query; binary-search the
              flip; mint the harvested column (Lemma 4.1 or 4.2); split
```


## 5. Correctness and complexity

**Theorem 5.1 (saturated fixpoint = the syntactic ω-semigroup).** The loop
terminates after at most `N` class splits. At its fixpoint — closed,
consistent, left-saturated, equivalence granted — the kernel of `ψ` on `Σ⁺` is
exactly `≈_L`, the map `c ↦ [rep(c)]_{≈_L}` identifies `𝒞_T` with the classes
of the target, identity included, and the export

```
    c·c' := fold(c, rep(c')),    λ, P as maintained,
    keys: shortlex-least word reaching each class — a BFS on the fold automaton
```

is exactly the finite presentation `(𝒞, λ, ·, P)` of `𝓘(L)` — in particular
byte-equal to the output of any construction of it [SωS26, Thms I, III].

*Proof.* *Termination.* Every mechanism that keeps a round going adds a class:
a promotion introduces a frontier word differing from every row on some column,
a consistency minting separates the violating pair on the minted column, a
saturation escalation and a counterexample harvest each split a class
(Theorem 4.3, Lemma 4.5). Every such witness is an Arnold context separating
two concrete words, so distinct classes are `≈_L`-distinct at all times, and
`|𝒞_T| ≤ N` bounds the total.

*The kernel is a two-sided congruence.* Right-invariance is Lemma 3.3. For
left-invariance, first extend the sweep's guarantee from table words to all
words: **claim** — `fold(d, u) = fold(d, w_{ψ(u)})` for every `d ∈ 𝒞_T` and
every `u ∈ Σ⁺`. Induction on `|u|`; for `u = u₁·a`:

```
    fold(d, u₁·a) = step(fold(d, u₁), a)             (definition)
                  = step(fold(d, w_{ψ(u₁)}), a)      (induction hypothesis)
                  = fold(d, w_{ψ(u₁)}·a)             (definition)
                  = fold(d, w_{ψ(u)})                (sweep: w_{ψ(u₁)}·a is a
                                                      frontier word, and
                                                      ψ(w_{ψ(u₁)}·a) = ψ(u))
```

The claim gives left-invariance: if `ψ(u) = ψ(v)` then for any `x`,
`ψ(x·u) = fold(ψ(x), u) = fold(ψ(x), w_{ψ(u)}) = fold(ψ(x), w_{ψ(v)})
= fold(ψ(x), v) = ψ(x·v)`.

*The export is an invariant, and it denotes `L`.* On `Σ⁺` the kernel is then
a two-sided congruence of finite index, so `ψ` restricted to the non-empty
words is a stamp `𝒮_T : Σ⁺ → 𝒞_T ∖ {[ε]}` [SωS26, Def 3.1] — surjective onto
the non-identity classes, `[ε]` being the permanent singleton — whose
multiplication is the exported table: `c·c' = fold(c, w_{c'}) = ψ(w_c·w_{c'})`,
folds composing over literal concatenation. The export `⟨𝒮_T, P⟩` is
therefore an invariant, and the prediction of §3 computes exactly its lasso
membership [SωS26, Def 3.4]: multiplicativity makes the fold orbit the power
sequence — `c_j = ψ(z^j) = ψ(z)^j` — so the stabilization test `c_{2k} = c_k`
reads `(ψ(z)^k)² = ψ(z)^k`: the orbit's stable value is the idempotent power
of `ψ(z)`, unique among its powers, and the predicting pair
`(ψ(w·z^k), c_k) = (𝒮_T(w)·e, e)` is Definition 3.4's queried name; the
cached bit is the teacher's verdict on a lasso bearing that name.
Equivalence granted, predictions agree with `L` on every lasso, through
every presentation: the export **denotes** `L` [SωS26, Def 4.1].

*Canonicity, by [SωS26, Cor 4.2].* An invariant denoting `L` has a kernel
refining `≈_L`, and carries the forced pair set — the names of the accepted
lassos, nothing else. Termination's witnesses give the reverse inclusion —
distinct classes are `≈_L`-distinct — so the kernel is exactly `≈_L`: `𝒮_T`
*is* the syntactic stamp, its pair set *is* `P(L)`, and the export is
`𝓘(L)`. The shortlex keys are recovered exactly because the fold is a
deterministic automaton: the shortlex-least word reaching class `c` under
BFS is the shortlex-least word of its `≈_L`-class. Byte equality with any
other construction of `𝓘(L)` is canonicity plus shortlex keying
[SωS26, Thm I]. ∎

The theorem earns the paper's title: nothing about the *language* forced the
fixpoint to be canonical — §4.2 exhibits the non-canonical stall — it is the
saturation rule, i.e. the rotation lemma's slot collapse, that pins the fixpoint
to the syntactic object. The step
*the export denotes `L`* consumes the equivalence oracle's exactness. Under
a bounded oracle the fixpoint is still a two-sided congruence (the sweep, not
the oracle, delivered left-invariance) and every split still witnesses a
genuine `≈_L`-separation, so the export is a well-defined finite algebra with
`≈_L`-distinct classes — but denotation of `L`, hence the coincidence with
`𝓘(L)` that [SωS26, Cor 4.2] extracts from it, is certified only as far as
the oracle checked.

The dual question — the fixpoint an exact oracle *did* certify, but the
sweep never touched — closes the unsaturated stall's account: such a
fixpoint is not merely short of the algebra; certified, it cannot carry an
algebra at all. The instrument is the sweep's own check, which turns out to
be a complete congruence test:

**Lemma 5.2 (the sweep check decides congruence).** On a closed, consistent
table, the kernel of `ψ` on `Σ*` — a right congruence by construction, being
the reachability kernel of the deterministic automaton `step` — is a
two-sided congruence iff the saturation sweep's check phase is clean:
`fold(d, u) = fold(d, w_{ψ(u)})` for every table word `u` and class `d`.

*Proof.* (⟸) Write `(S)` for the check's instances at frontier words:
`fold(d, w_c·a) = fold(d, w_{step(c,a)})` for all `d, c ∈ 𝒞_T`, `a ∈ Σ` — all
table words, so a clean check includes them. Induction on `|u|` extends the
check to every word, `fold(d, u) = fold(d, w_{ψ(u)})`: the base case is `(S)`
at `c = [ε]`, and the step is
`fold(d, u'·a) = step(fold(d, u'), a) = step(fold(d, w_{ψ(u')}), a)
= fold(d, w_{ψ(u')}·a) = fold(d, w_{ψ(u'·a)})`, the last equality by `(S)` at
`c = ψ(u')`. Left-invariance follows as in Theorem 5.1's proof; right-
invariance is automatic. (⟹) Two-sidedness makes
`fold(d, u) = ψ(w_d·u)` a function of `(d, ψ(u))`, and `ψ(u) = ψ(w_{ψ(u)})`
on table words is coherence (Lemma 3.3). ∎

(The forward direction is the claim inside Theorem 5.1's proof, extracted;
the lemma adds its converse, making the check a *classifier*: zero queries,
run on any fixpoint, saturated or not.)

**Theorem 5.3 (certified fixpoints: canonical or no algebra).** Let a
closed, consistent table's hypothesis be certified by an exact equivalence
oracle — its prediction agrees with `L` on every lasso. Then the following
are equivalent: (i) the kernel of `ψ` is a congruence (Lemma 5.2's check is
clean); (ii) the export of Theorem 5.1 is exactly `𝓘(L)`, byte-equal after
re-keying. In particular a certified *non-canonical* fixpoint — a permanent
stall — is never a congruence: its product `c·c' = fold(c, w_{c'})`
genuinely depends on the choice of representatives, and no operation on its
classes recognizes anything. What the ablation of §6.3 delivers is the
Cayley hypothesis itself — a correct acceptor — and, provably, nothing more.

*Proof.* (ii)⟹(i): `𝓘(L)`'s classes form a monoid. (i)⟹(ii): Theorem 5.1's
last two steps consume exactly these hypotheses and nothing else. With the
kernel a congruence — (i), via Lemma 5.2 — the export is an invariant whose
lasso membership is the hypothesis's prediction, and the certification makes
it denote `L`; [SωS26, Cor 4.2] then forces the kernel to refine `≈_L` and
the pair set to be the names of `L`'s accepted lassos. Every split —
promotion, consistency mint, harvest — was witnessed by an Arnold context
(saturation escalations, absent here, were only ever one more witnessed
mechanism), so `≈_L` refines the kernel; the two inclusions pin the kernel
to `≈_L`, and the export is `𝓘(L)` — byte-equal after re-keying (with (i),
`mult` by letter classes *is* `step`, so the two BFS orders coincide, and
`P` — teacher bits on representative lassos — is the forced pair set). *In
particular*: by (i)⟹(ii), a certified fixpoint whose kernel were a
congruence would be canonical; a certified stall is non-canonical, so its
kernel is no congruence, its product depends on representatives, and no
operation on its classes recognizes anything. ∎

Note the asymmetry the exactness buys: under a bounded oracle a congruent
unsaturated fixpoint may still be a genuine algebra strictly coarser than
the syntactic quotient — a correct-so-far quotient the oracle was too weak
to refute. Exactness closes that door: congruent and certified *forces*
canonical — [SωS26, Cor 4.2]'s *nowhere else*, met from below — so
the two-sided/one-sided divide of §4.2 is also the algebra/no-algebra
divide. Proposition 4.4's non-associative display is Theorem 5.3 made
concrete on the smallest specimen — the display shows *how* the product
breaks; the theorem says it always does.

*Example (the run, completed, on `Even`).* After §4.3's split the table is
Table 6, and the next sweep and equivalence query are clean. The whole run,
Tables 1 → 3(b) → 6: five classes from **two splits — one per mechanism** (the
stem chain split `aa` from `a`, the saturation escalation split `a·!a` from
`a`) — on **three columns** (`(ε,ε)_ω` initial, `(ε, !a, aa!a)_lin` harvested,
`(ε, a!a, aa!a)_lin` saturated). The BFS re-keying returns
`ε, !a, a, a!a, aa`, and the exported table `c·c' = fold(c, w_{c'})` is

```
  ·      [ε]  [!a]  [a]  [a!a]  [aa]
  [ε]     0    1     2     3     4
  [!a]    1    1     1     1     1
  [a]     2    3     4     1     2
  [a!a]   3    3     3     3     3
  [aa]    4    1     2     3     4
```

— cell for cell the syntactic table of [SωS26], computed there from a
deterministic automaton and here from lasso queries alone: Theorem 5.1,
performed. Two read-offs complete the export (Table 7): the accepting pairs,
and the aperiodicity check.

*(a) linked pairs `(s, e)`, `e` ranging over the idempotents; cell = the
accept bit of `w_s·(w_e)^ω`, `–` = not linked (`s·e ≠ s`):*

| `s` \ `e` | `[!a]` | `[a!a]` | `[aa]` |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `[!a]` | **1** | **1** | **1** |
| `[a]` | – | – | `0` |
| `[a!a]` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `[aa]` | – | – | `0` |

*(b) power orbits `c, c², c³, …`:*

| `c` | `c²` | `c³` | eventual period |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `[!a]` | `[!a]` | `[!a]` | 1 |
| `[a]` | `[aa]` | `[a]` | **2** |
| `[a!a]` | `[a!a]` | `[a!a]` | 1 |
| `[aa]` | `[aa]` | `[aa]` | 1 |

**Table 7.** The learned `𝓘(Even)`'s two read-offs. (a) Eight linked pairs,
three accepting — the whole `[!a]` stem row: once the good prefix has
happened, every loop accepts; this is `P`. (b) Power iteration of every
class: a single orbit of period two, `[a] → [aa] → [a]` — the genuine `Z₂` —
so `Even` is **not** LTL-definable, read off the learned object in four
lines (the aperiodicity read-off, [SωS26, Thm 6.1]). Five classes is exactly
`N = 5`, and the exported invariant is byte-equal to the construction from
the automaton — the harness's final check.

`EvenBlocks` completes the same way, and entirely in the ω-sort: beyond the
counterexample traced in §4.1, two saturation escalations carry the table
from four to its eight classes — keys
`ε, !a, a, !a·a, a·!a, a·a, !a·a·!a, a·!a·a`, the count and keys fixed by the
reference invariant. Table 8 is the run as a split ledger, one row per event,
from the implementation's transcript — deterministic under the pinned scan
and minimal-counterexample policies, and reproducing §4.1's row exactly. One
reading note: a single sweep mint can split more than one class once the
table re-stabilizes — rows 2 and 3 each split two.

| # | trigger | chain | minted column | splits | `\|𝒞_T\|` after |
|:--:|---|---|---|---|:--:|
| 1 | EQ: `(ε, !a·aa)` | loop | `(a, a)_ω` | `!a·a` out of `[a]` | 4 |
| 2 | sweep escalation | frozen | `(a, !a·a)_ω` | `aa` out of `[a]`; `a·!a` out of `[!a·a]` | 6 |
| 3 | sweep escalation | frozen | `(ε, !a)_ω` | `a·!a·a` out of `[!a]`; `!a·a·!a` out of `[aa]` | 8 |

**Table 8.** The `EvenBlocks` run as a split ledger: trigger (equivalence
counterexample or sweep escalation), the chain that processed it, the minted
column, the words separated. The day-one sweep is clean — every fold check
on Table 2's three-class table agrees, the computation Table 4 spells out
for `Even` — so row 1, §4.1's split, is the run's first event; rows 2–3 are the sweep
enforcing two-sidedness — no second counterexample is ever needed, and the
run's second equivalence query certifies. Every one of the four columns is
of the ω-sort: prefix-independence in action (the linear shape is blind —
Proposition 4.6 — so every separation lives in the loop). The final sweep mints `(ε, !a)` — the very
column §3 exhibited by inspection. The resulting bit-signatures are the
fixpoint (the Table 6 analogue), pairwise distinct — with `[ε]`, the `N = 8`
classes of `𝓘(EvenBlocks)`:

| word | `(ε,ε)_ω` | `(a,a)_ω` | `(a,!a·a)_ω` | `(ε,!a)_ω` |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `!a` | `1` | `0` | `0` | `1` |
| `a` | `0` | `0` | `1` | `0` |
| `!a·a` | `0` | `1` | `0` | `0` |
| `a·!a` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` |
| `a·a` | `0` | `0` | `0` | `1` |
| `!a·a·!a` | `0` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `a·!a·a` | `1` | `0` | `0` | `0` |

The per-phase membership ledgers of the two runs ground Proposition 5.4's
itemization in the two small instances (`fill` — table entries; `harvest` —
junction and chain probes; `saturation` — escalation probes and frozen
chains; `P` — the pair cache):

| run | fill | harvest | saturation | `P`-cache | total | EQ | sweep escalations | columns lin/ω |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `Even` | 32 | 4 | 7 | 8 | **51** | 2 | 1 | 2 / 1 |
| `EvenBlocks` | 67 | 4 | 14 | 14 | **99** | 2 | 2 | 0 / 4 |

Both runs finish on a *single* counterexample — every other split is the
sweep's, two-probe escalations in place of whole equivalence rounds — and
both exported invariants are byte-equal to the reference construction.

**Proposition 5.4 (query complexity).** Recall `N` — the class count of the
canonical target, identity included (§2.2) — and write `ℓ` for the
longest counterexample returned. The learner poses at most `N` equivalence
queries and `O(N²·|Σ| + N·log(N·ℓ))` membership queries, itemized by
mechanism:

- *table entries* — `O(N·|Σ|)` table words (at most `N` rows, each with its
  `|Σ|`-letter frontier) against `O(N)` columns (one initial; every other
  column is minted by an event that also splits a class, so at most one per
  split);
- *per harvest split* (at most one per equivalence query) — one junction
  query and one binary search over a chain of length
  `|w'| + |z'| = O(N·ℓ)` (the normalization power is at most `2N`), so
  `O(log(N·ℓ))` queries;
- *per saturation split* — two probe queries and at most one frozen-prefix
  binary search over the segment `r·u`, of length `O(N)` since
  representatives and table words are access words of length `O(N)`
  (Definition 3.2), so `O(log N)` queries;
- *the `P`-cache* — one membership query per linked pair of the final
  table, at most `N²`, absorbed by the entry term.

All queried words have length polynomial in `N`, `ℓ`, and the column
lengths — themselves harvested substrings of counterexamples, or `O(N)`-long
segments contributed by saturation. Output-polynomial in the canonical
target `N` is the honest yardstick — `N` can be exponentially larger than a
smallest acceptor (Proposition 5.5 makes both directions of the size
comparison exact), and §6 measures exactly that.

The converse of the yardstick is the selling point: on languages with trivial or
near-trivial right congruence — `EvenBlocks`, `FG(a ∨ Xa)` [AF21], and
generically tail properties — the right-congruence-seeded part of any FDFA
degenerates while nothing here does, because nothing here is seeded by the right
congruence: the ω-columns query the loop structure directly. The historical arc
makes the point structural: [MP95] is exactly the fragment where the right
congruence is the whole story, and every extension since has been a workaround
for its failure — this one replaces the seed rather than patching it.

The size relationship between the two kinds of target can be settled exactly
rather than empirically, and it cuts one way:

**Proposition 5.5 (sizes cut one way).** (a) Every
canonical FDFA of `L` — periodic, syntactic, or recurrent [AF16] — has at
most `N + N²` states. (b) The converse fails exponentially: for every `n`
there is a co-safety `L_n` over a fixed five-letter alphabet with a
deterministic acceptor of `n + 2` states, a recurrent FDFA of size `O(n)`
and a syntactic FDFA of size `O(n²)`, but `N ≥ (n+1)^n`.

*Proof.* (a) `≈_L` refines every congruence an FDFA is built from. Leading:
`u ≈_L v` gives agreement under every continuation `y·t^ω` (the linear shape
at `x = ε`), and residual languages are ω-regular, hence determined by their
lassos [PP04] — so `u ~_L v`, and the leading automaton has at most `N`
states. Progress, at a leading class `[u]`: if `v ≈_L v'` then `vw ≈_L v'w`
for every `w`, and the ω-power shape at `x = u`, `y = ε` gives
`u·(vw)^ω ∈ L ⟺ u·(v'w)^ω ∈ L` — exactly the periodic progress congruence;
the syntactic and recurrent congruences add only clauses of the forms
`uv ~_L uv'` and `uvw ~_L u`, which `≈_L`-equal words satisfy equally. So
each progress automaton has at most `N` states, and there is one per leading
state. (b) Take four letters acting on `{1, …, n}` and generating the monoid
`PT_n` of all partial transformations (two generate the permutations, one
lowers rank, one restricts the domain — a standard generating set; undefined
images go to a rejecting sink `⊥`), plus a letter `c` sending state `1` to an
accepting sink `⊤` and every other state to `⊥`; let `L_n` be "the run
reaches `⊤`" — a run *commits* when it does, is *doomed* at `⊥`, and is
*uncommitted* otherwise. Distinct
partial maps `f ≠ g` are `≈_{L_n}`-inequivalent: pick `q` with
`f(q) ≠ g(q)`, reach `q` from `1` by a permutation word `x` (action letters
never touch `⊤`, so nothing commits en route), and append a permutation `π`
carrying `f(q)` to `1`, then `c`: the linear context `x·_·π·c·(c)^ω` accepts
through `f` and rejects through `g`. Hence `N ≥ |PT_n| = (n+1)^n`. For the
FDFAs, the leading congruence has `n + 2` classes (the current state, or
committed, or doomed), and for a co-safety language the progress clauses
*collapse*: if `u` is uncommitted and `uvw ~_L u`, the loop returned to
`u`'s state without ever committing, so `u·(vw)^ω ∉ L` — the ω-clause is
constantly false. The recurrent conjunction is therefore constant on every
leading class (false on uncommitted and doomed, true on committed), giving
`O(1)` progress states each; the syntactic congruence reduces to its
`uv ~_L uv'` clause, giving at most `n + 2` each. ∎

Read as economics, Proposition 5.5 settles the size question in both directions:
an FDFA never pays more than a quadratic premium over the algebra, while the
algebra can cost exponentially more than any acceptor — on `L_n`, an FDFA
learner spends queries polynomial in `n` where ours spends queries
polynomial in `(n+1)^n`. That is not an inefficiency to engineer away; it is
the price of the deliverable. The algebra `L_n` owns *is* that large, every
definability read-off consumes it, and any route to it — learned here,
constructed in [SωS26] — pays `N`. Output-polynomial in `N`
(Proposition 5.4) is the strongest guarantee compatible with delivering the
object. The unsaturated stall of §4.2, for its part, is not an isolated
artifact: Proposition 4.4's `a → Xa` is the smallest exhibit an exhaustive
census of one-atom automata can produce, and §6.3 measures the family at
census scale.


## 6. Evaluation

The algorithm of §3–5 is implemented as a pure query learner: its only source
of truth is the teacher interface, and no automaton is ever visible to it.
The evaluation answers three questions, each measured against the canonical
target `N`. **Q1 — cost:** do measured queries track the output-polynomial
bounds of Proposition 5.4? **Q2 — the ablation:** how often does the learner
without saturation stall, and are the stalls §4.2's — is saturation doing
real work across a corpus, not only on Proposition 4.4's two specimens?
**Q3 — the baseline:** against an established FDFA learner on identical
teachers, what does the algebra cost, and what does it buy? A fourth,
smaller question calibrates a constant: how sensitive is the cost to the
teacher's counterexample policy — the `log(N·ℓ)` term of Proposition 5.4.
Across a complement-closed census of 6222 languages the learner returns
every canonical invariant exactly, at `N` up to 208; saturation is
indispensable on half of them — 3137 certified permanent stalls,
prefix-independent languages included, whose algebras no counterexample can
deliver; and the invariant answers LTL-definability on every language, which
no FDFA does.

### 6.1 Protocol

**Teacher.** As fixed in §2.3: membership is one deterministic run,
`O(|u| + |Q|·|v|)`; equivalence is a cheap representative audit followed by
an exact *align-and-scan* against the reference invariant. The hypothesis's
fold automaton is aligned with `𝓘(L)`: the letter-generated graph of pairs
`(ψ(w), 𝒮_L(w))` — the hypothesis's fold against the syntactic stamp —
is built lazily and memoized, and on every cell (stem node, loop node) two
verdicts are compared: the hypothesis's prediction on the cell's keyed
lasso, and the invariant's algebraic verdict `(s·e^π, e^π) ∈ P`. A flagged
cell's keyed lasso is a genuine counterexample outright — both verdicts are
evaluated on that concrete lasso. That one keyed lasso per cell also
*decides* the cell — the certification and minimality claims — because both
verdicts are constant on cells: the invariant's is, since membership
factors through `𝒮_L` of stem and loop; the hypothesis's is *provided the
aligned graph is functional* — no two nodes share their `𝓘(L)`-component,
i.e. the fold never splits a syntactic class — for then the loop orbit, the
stabilization power, and the predicting pair are all determined by the
cell. Functionality is not assumed, and it genuinely fails mid-run — the
fold of a closed, consistent table can *split* a syntactic class beyond its
table words (realized on a census language: `!a·!a·a ≈_L a·!a·!a`, yet the
two words fold to different classes), so a mid-run hypothesis is not merely
coarser than the algebra (§4.2) but incomparable with it. The oracle
therefore asserts functionality on the built graph at every query, and a
firing hands the query to the fallback — the product of the automaton with
the hypothesis's transformation closure, which needs no such assumption.
The guard is no corner case — it fires on 2694 of the 6222 runs (3398
firings) — and the fallback finished inside its work cap on every one:
certification is exact on all 6222 runs; only the ablation leg of §6.3
carries cases that never reach certification, recorded there as undecided.
That leg leans hardest on exactness — a permanence verdict certifies a
*non-canonical* fixpoint, the one claim byte-equality cannot re-validate —
while every other reported run is additionally validated end-to-end by
byte-equality of the exported invariant against the constructed reference.
One honesty note: the oracle and the byte-equality validation share their
trust anchor, the constructed `𝓘(L)`; independence from the automaton is
retained through the teacher self-check, which cross-checks `D`-simulation
against the invariant read-off on 10⁴ random lassos per case.
Counterexamples are minimal (shortest stem, then shortest loop, then
shortlex) — keys being shortlex-least and cells scanned in lasso order, the
least disagreeing cell yields exactly that. One lasso membership is one
query; equivalence queries are counted separately (§2.1).

**Corpus.** The census is a flat, complement-closed catalogue of **6222**
ω-regular languages over one to three atomic propositions
(`|Σ| = 2^AP`, up to 8): each language appears exactly once, one canonical
representative up to atomic-proposition relabeling, and each is accompanied
by its complement. Every language with a small presentation is in the
catalogue — nondeterministic presentations count: `a → Xa`, whose smallest
*deterministic* acceptor has four states (its four residuals force them),
enters through a two-state presentation. Every input is determinized on
import; ground truth is computed by the construction of [SωS26]: the
reference `𝓘(L)`, its class count `N` — from 2 to 208 — and its LTL
verdict. The three running examples are mandatory in every experiment, as
are the two permanent-stall specimens of §4.2. One convention governs every
count that depends on a per-case budget: the ablation classifies each
language at a stated 60 s budget, decided verdicts are floors — a decided
case never flips between drops — and undecided cases are reported, never
folded into a count.

**Reproducibility and validation.** Runs are deterministic — the sweep's
scan order is pinned (§4.3), counterexamples are minimal — so the traces of
§3–5 are the transcripts of the corresponding runs. Validation is Theorem
5.1 exercised end-to-end: the learned invariant is byte-equal to the
constructed reference, on **all 6222** languages, `N` from 2 to 208, zero
mismatches. Two automata for `GF(aa)` yield byte-identical ledgers and
signature matrices: Theorem 5.1's presentation-independence, on the
learner's side.

### 6.2 Cost against the canonical target (Q1)

For every case we record membership queries by phase — table fill,
counterexample harvest, saturation, the `P`-cache — plus equivalence queries,
splits, and columns by sort, against `N`. The named cases in full, the two
§5 ledgers among them:

| case | `N` | initial | splits | member (fill/harvest/sat/`P`) | equiv | cex |
|---|--:|--:|--:|---|--:|--:|
| `a ∧ XG¬a` | 4 | 2 | 2 | 35 (26/3/2/4) | 2 | 1 |
| `a → Xa` | 5 | 4 | 1 | 43 (32/0/2/9) | 1 | 0 |
| `Even` | 5 | 3 | 2 | 51 (32/4/7/8) | 2 | 1 |
| `GF(aa)` | 6 | 3 | 3 | 74 (51/4/9/10) | 2 | 1 |
| `EvenBlocks` | 8 | 3 | 5 | 99 (67/4/14/14) | 2 | 1 |

(*initial* = classes of the first stabilized table; on every row the split
count is exactly `N −` initial.) The `GF(aa)` row also pays off §2.3's
promise: the learned invariant's power orbits all have period one —
aperiodic, the presentation's `Z₂` destroyed — so its LTL verdict is read
off the learned object, as `Even`'s non-LTL verdict was in Table 7(b). The
designed bounds hold on every case: `splits ≤ N`, the fill term inside
`N²·|Σ|` (at `N = 8`, 67 against 128), harvest and saturation adding the
counterexample-analysis term. Over the whole census `splits ≤ N` holds on
every language — the sharpest, at `N = 208`, splits 194 times — and the
fill term tracks the quadratic envelope at every alphabet size; the per-`N`
aggregates mix alphabets, so a bucket reads against `N²·|Σ|` at its own
`|Σ|` — the `N = 4` bucket's `|Σ| = 8` majority has median fill 145 against
its envelope of 128, its `|Σ| = 2` minority 17 against 32. Equivalence
queries never leave the single digits — at most 6, across the entire
catalogue, `N = 208` included. Median membership by class count traces the
quadratic growth (the two `N = 2` languages are `∅` and `Σ^ω`, as the
adjoined identity demands):

| `N` | 2 | 4 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 32 | 50 | 72 | 97 | 121 | 208 |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| median member | 3 | 151 | 124 | 262 | 567 | 1007 | 2043 | 3098 | 4768 | 7449 | 27054 |
| median equiv | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |

The fill term dominates, harvest is logarithmic (§6.5), saturation a small
constant per split. Soundness is uniform across the LTL cut; raw cost is
not — the genuinely ω-counting half is the expensive half:

| definability | languages | median `N` | median splits | median member |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| LTL (aperiodic) | 3738 | 12 | 9 | 291 |
| non-LTL | 2484 | 20 | 16 | 557 |

But the entire signal is `N` itself. Normalized by the designed bounds the
cut disappears — median `splits/N` is 0.71 against 0.81, the fill envelope
ratio 0.71 against 0.57 — and the same holds across the Wagner hierarchy:
no degree is intrinsically harder to learn. The group structure that
defeats LTL-definability inflates the algebra the learner must reconstruct;
given its size, the learner is classification-blind. Wall time follows the
same account: the full census costs 10733 s single-threaded — median
0.12 s per language, the worst case 49.6 s at `N = 68`.

### 6.3 The saturation ablation (Q2)

The learner runs with and without the sweep, the ablated leg under the exact
oracle, and each language is classified by its stall: **none** — the first
closed, consistent fixpoint is already canonical; **transient** — a
non-canonical fixpoint, broken by a counterexample; **permanent** — a
non-canonical fixpoint the exact oracle certifies, which no counterexample
breaks. Only the left-context sweep splits a permanent stall; without it the
learner stops on the Cayley acceptor and nothing more — by Theorem 5.3 a
certified stall's partition is never a congruence, so there is no algebra on
its classes to export: on the ablation leg "export" is a refusal, the
recorded outcome *correct acceptor, no algebra*. Theorem 5.3 is also
performed at census scale: on every one of the 3137 certified permanent
stalls, Lemma 5.2's congruence check fails, and on every one of the 2336
byte-equal recoveries it passes — zero off-diagonal mass, and the verdicts
agree on all 2733 dual pairs with both sides decided. At the 60 s budget
the partition reads 3137 permanent / 2336 recovered / 736 undecided, with
13 languages beyond the exact oracle's reach — their aligned graphs are
non-functional and the fallback product exceeds its work cap, so their
permanent-vs-transient classification is recorded as deferred and never
folded into the counts, while their saturated runs remain byte-exact.
Decided counts are floors: undecided cases can later resolve, decided ones
never flip.

Permanent stalls are not rare — they are the majority. **3137 of the 6222
languages stall permanently**: without saturation the learner loses the
algebra on half the catalogue. The gap between the stalled right congruence
and the syntactic algebra reaches **53** classes; its head:

| gap `N − stall` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ⋯ | 46 | 48 | 53 |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| languages | 661 | 533 | 467 | 332 | 242 | 140 | 149 | 99 | 75 | 31 | ⋯ | 2 | 2 | 2 |

The median gap is 3 — most stalls are a few classes short — but the tail is
long, and its sharpest specimens come in dual pairs: at gap 53, a language
and its complement with `N = 68` stalled at 15 classes, the stalled
acceptor barely a fifth of its algebra. Permanence and gap are
complement-invariant — a run on the complement of `L` is the bit-flip of
the run on `L` — and the ablation confirms it wherever both duals are
decided; the raw counts above are budget-censored floors, so buckets need
not pair off exactly.

Two structural facts. Permanence **cuts across the LTL boundary** — 1741 of
the 3137 are LTL-definable, tracking the catalogue's own composition: the
permanent stall measures the gap between the right and the two-sided
congruence, not ω-counting power; aperiodic languages stall as readily as
group-bearing ones. And prefix-dependence is **not necessary** — but where
prefix-independent stalls live is sharply structured. Of the 3137, **231
are prefix-independent** (the check is algebraic, on the canonical
invariant: acceptance invariant under every left multiplication of the stem
class), and every one of them sits at a transfinite Wagner degree: all 2164
permanent stalls of finite degree — safety and guarantee prominent among
them — are prefix-dependent. That is the mechanism split of §4 realized at
census scale: a permanent stall is a separation only a left context
recovers; prefix-independence silences the linear shape's left contexts
(Proposition 4.6), while the ω-power shape's left action survives it as a
rotation (Corollary 4.7) — and it is from the ω-th degree upward, starting
at deterministic-Büchi and co-Büchi power, that prefix-independent
permanent stalls in fact appear. Two of them, with their complements, carry
the full Corollary 4.7 certificate: `N = 10` stalled at 8 and `N = 16`
stalled at 14, prefix-independence verified algebraically on the canonical
invariant, and every column their saturated runs mint an ω-column (4.7(b))
— the recovering left contexts acting inside the loop, where no prefix
exists to delete. On every one of the 3137, at every scale, saturation
recovers the canonical algebra (the census-wide soundness of §6.1);
`a → Xa` does it with zero counterexamples and a single equivalence query:
the sweep supplies what the oracle cannot (Proposition 4.4).

### 6.4 The FDFA baseline (Q3)

The baseline is ROLL [LCZL21, LSTCX19], the classification-tree FDFA learner,
in its periodic / syntactic / recurrent modes, on the same census languages
under the same counting rule (one lasso = one membership query). Two
adaptations follow from ROLL's interface. ROLL learns the language of a
Büchi automaton, so it receives a state-based Büchi presentation of each
language (Spot's `SBAcc` — ROLL misreads a transition-based Büchi input as a
trivial language): the language is the same, the presentation ROLL's, so
membership counts are presentation-sensitive and the comparison rests on
output size and capability. And the two learners certify equivalence by
different but both exact mechanisms — ours the align-and-scan against the
language's invariant (§2.3), ROLL's its native automaton equivalence
(RABIT).

The named-case paired table (ROLL's size is the summed states of its FDFA,
leading plus progress DFAs):

| case | ours `N` (MQ/EQ) | ROLL periodic | syntactic | recurrent |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `GF(aa)` | 6 (74/2) | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| `Even` | 5 (51/2) | 12 | 15 | 9 |
| `EvenBlocks` | 8 (99/2) | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| `a → Xa` | 5 (43/1) | 12 | 14 | 9 |
| `a ∧ XG¬a` | 4 (35/2) | 8 | 10 | 7 |

Every entry lies inside Proposition 5.5(a)'s `N + N²` envelope, and within
it the two objects trade places. Across the census the median class count
is `N = 16`, against FDFA-size medians 16 / 21 / 12 (periodic / syntactic /
recurrent); over the 5960 languages both learners decide, against each
language's smallest FDFA the algebra is smaller on 2032, larger on 3574,
tied on 354. Size is comparable — a wash inside the envelope; the
exponential separation of Proposition 5.5(b) needs larger algebras than the
census reaches. The trade is not noise, though — it correlates with the LTL
cut. On aperiodic languages the two objects are near parity (algebra
smaller on 1524, larger on 1842, tied on 207); on group-bearing languages
the FDFA usually wins the size comparison (508 / 1732 / 147): the group
structure that blocks LTL-definability is also what inflates the algebra
against an acceptor — Proposition 5.5(b)'s mechanism, visible at census
scale.

The comparison's result is capability. From the learned invariant,
LTL-definability is a read-off — the aperiodicity test of §2.2 — computed
on every case and agreeing with ground truth on all 6222: every run
certifies exact, so the read-off is evaluated on an invariant byte-equal to
the reference. From an FDFA it is not answerable without a further
construction. One learner returns the language's algebra, from which
definability is read; the other returns an acceptor, from which it is not.

### 6.5 Counterexample sensitivity

Proposition 5.4 depends on the teacher only through the `log(N·ℓ)` harvest
term. The counterexample-bearing named cases are re-run under counterexample
policies — minimal (the default) and adversarially padded, stem and loop
pumped by factors 2 to 32 — comparing total and harvest-only membership
queries. As the loop is pumped from length 3 to 96 the harvest term grows
from 4 to 9 queries: one query per doubling, `harvest ≈ log₂ ℓ`, the binary
search over the stem/loop chain, the learned invariant unchanged. Padding
costs queries, not correctness. (A first-found policy coincides with minimal
for the shortlex-least oracles used here, so it forms no separate series.)


## 7. Related work

**Active learning of ω-regular languages.** The line begins with Maler and
Pnueli [MP95], who lift L\* [Ang87] to the subclass of languages `L` with both
`L` and its complement deterministic-Büchi-recognizable — exactly the class
where, by the Staiger theorem they build on [Sta83], the syntactic right
congruence carries the whole language, so a prefix observation table converges.
Farzan et al. [FCC+08] reach the full class by learning the `$`-language
`{u$v : u·v^ω ∈ L}` — introduced, and proved regular and complete for `L`, by
Calbrix, Nivat and Podelski [CNP93] — with plain L\* and extracting a
nondeterministic Büchi automaton. Angluin and Fisman [AF16] systematize this direction as families of
DFAs — a leading right-congruence automaton with per-state progress DFAs — in
three canonical flavors (periodic, syntactic, recurrent), the periodic one being
the FDFA rendering of the `$`-language [LCZL21]; Angluin, Boker and Fisman
[ABF18] study FDFAs as acceptors in their own right, and the trivial-right-
congruence obstruction is [AF21]. Li, Chen, Zhang and Liu [LCZL21] give the
classification-tree FDFA learner implemented in ROLL [LSTCX19], our experimental
baseline. On the passive side, Bohn and Löding extend RPNI to deterministic
ω-automata [BL21] and learn deterministic Büchi automata from samples by
combinations of DFAs [BL22]. All of these target acceptors. Nearest to our
ω-columns in spirit are Michaliszyn and Otop's *loop-index queries* [MO22]:
alongside membership and equivalence, their teacher reveals, for each lasso,
after how many letters *the target automaton* enters its final cycle — an
oracle that, by design, "depend[s] on a particular automaton" [MO22]. It buys
polynomial-time learning of deterministic Büchi automata and, through
LimSup-weighted automata, of deterministic parity automata — the full
ω-regular class — at the price that both the auxiliary query and the learned
object are tied to the teacher's presentation. Our ω-columns probe the same
loop structure through plain lasso memberships, and the limit is
presentation-independent; indeed [MO22]'s own motivation notes that at ω
"there is no notion of the canonical (syntactic) automaton" — true of
automata, and precisely the gap the algebra fills.

**Algebraic learning.** Van Heerdt, Sammartino and Silva's CALF [vHSS17] frames
automata learning categorically but instantiates no ω-algorithm. The decisive
step is Urbat and Schröder [US20], and the relationship is precise.
Generically, for languages recognized by a monad `T`, they prove that the
syntactic `T`-algebra is the minimal automaton of a *linearized* language
over the alphabet of an automata presentation of the free algebra —
`Syn(L) ≅ Min(lin(L))` [US20, Thm 5.14] — and learn that automaton by a
generalized L\*. Instantiated to Wilke algebras this covers ω-regular
languages, in principle. In instance it is not effective: the presentation
validating the isomorphism carries the sorted alphabet
`Σ₊,ω = {ω} ∪ {·v^ω : v ∈ Σ⁺}`, whose letters are *operations* — `ω` sends
`w` to `w^ω`, and `·v^ω` sends `w` to `w·v^ω`: one letter per finite word
`v`, Arnold's ω-power contexts recast as an *infinite alphabet* — while the
finite restriction to `{ω}` alone is only a *weak* presentation, outside the
theorem, of which [US20] itself notes that the resulting learned object
resembles a family of DFAs. The rotation lemma is exactly the missing
finiteness: no ω-power context need be an alphabet letter known in advance,
because a counterexample-driven harvest of at most `|𝒞|` ω-columns reaches
the same congruence (§4, Theorem 5.1). [US20] settles what the target is;
this paper makes the ω-instance an algorithm, and runs it. Counterexample
processing in §4 adapts the binary-search analysis of Rivest and Schapire
[RS93].

**The algebra itself.** The two-sorted finite-word/ω-word algebra is Wilke's
[Wil93], in the ω-semigroup form of Perrin and Pin [PP04]; the congruence is
Arnold's [Arn85], its finitary/infinitary display Maler and Staiger's [MS97],
and its materialization as the invariant `𝓘(L)` — with the rotation lemma
this paper transports — is [SωS26]. In sum: [MP95] learned the class
where the right congruence suffices; the FDFA line patched the right congruence
with families of acceptors; [US20] identified the canonical algebraic target
without an effective ω-instance; this paper learns that target, effectively.

## 8. Conclusion

The syntactic ω-semigroup was constructible [SωS26]; it is now learnable,
and by the same mechanism. The rotation lemma, which on the construction
side made the two-sided congruence computable from an automaton, splits on
the learner's side in two: a harvest, where every counterexample pays for a
new table column, and a saturation sweep of checks that cost no queries.
The sweep is the surprise: without it the learner stalls — permanently,
already on `a → Xa` — on a hypothesis that is certified correct as an
acceptor yet provably carries no algebra, and no counterexample ever
arrives to save it. With it, the learner's limit is not an acceptor chosen
from a family but the language's syntactic invariant, the object
definability questions are read from: learning and classification cease to
be separate activities. A complement-closed census of 6222 languages bears
this out — every invariant reconstructed byte-for-byte, half of the census
reached only through the sweep.
