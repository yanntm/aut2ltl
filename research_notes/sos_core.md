*Working draft — 2026-07-13*

## Abstract

- The syntactic ω-semigroup: canonical, complete, defined since Arnold 1985, never built.
- Contribution 1: the object itself, reified as `𝓘 = ⟨𝒜, P⟩` — an algebra
  `𝒜 = (𝒞, λ, M)` and an acceptance layer `P` over it — with a standalone
  lasso-membership semantics: a canonical normal form for ω-regular languages, which
  the domain has never had.
- Contribution 2: the rotation lemma — the two-sided syntactic congruence is computable
  by right multiplications alone; the structural fact missing from 40 years of literature.
- Contribution 3: the construction from any deterministic Emerson–Lei automaton,
  assembling the two, with correctness `L(𝓘(D)) = L(D)` proved against the semantics.

## 1. Introduction

- Finite words have a normal form (the minimal DFA) and forty years of tooling on it;
  ω-words have none — no minimal deterministic automaton, every pipeline manipulates
  presentations, never languages.
- Arnold's syntactic ω-semigroup is the canonical algebra in principle and a phantom in
  practice: defined everywhere, built nowhere.
- The obstruction is structural (recognizers forget acceptance along runs; the
  congruence is two-sided) — kept from current §1, now as the bridge to Part B.
- Contributions restated: the object (§3), its uses as evidence of significance (§4),
  canonicity (§5), the construction with the rotation lemma at its core (§6–8).
- The three running examples announced — `GF(aa)`, `Even`, `EvenBlocks` — met first as
  tables, only later as automata.

## 2. Background

We fix a finite alphabet `Σ` and write `Σ*` for the finite words over it, `Σ^ω` for
the infinite ones, `Σ^∞ = Σ* ∪ Σ^ω`. A **language** here is a set of infinite words,
`L ⊆ Σ^ω`; we take `L` **regular** (ω-regular [PP04]) — the class with finite-memory
descriptions, and exactly the class the object of §3 captures. All examples in this
paper live over the two-letter alphabet `Σ = {a, b}`. This section fixes the few
classical notions the object rests on, adapting the presentation of Perrin and Pin
[PP04], each paired with the intuition tying the algebra back to languages of
infinite words.

Consider the language of Carton and Perrin [CP97, Ex. 10] described by `a*·b^ω` —
some `a`'s, then `b`'s forever — which we name `AsThenBs`. Its syntactic ω-semigroup
is drawn in Figure 1.

![Figure 1 — the object of AsThenBs](sos_core_figs/img/core_F0_astar_bomega.png)

*Figure 1 — the syntactic ω-semigroup of `AsThenBs = a*·b^ω`: five classes of finite
words, the letter steps between them, and the accepting pairs `P` beneath.*

**We only ever look at lassos.** A **lasso** (ultimately-periodic word) is `u·v^ω`: a
finite **stem** `u`, then a finite nonempty **loop** `v` repeated forever. The
organizing fact: *two regular ω-languages are equal iff they agree on all lassos*
[PP04]. Classifying `L` is therefore sorting lassos into finitely many types, and
every object below is machinery for naming and sorting them.

*Example.* `b^ω`, `ab·b^ω` and `aab·(bb)^ω` are lassos of `AsThenBs`; `ba·(ab)^ω` is a
lasso outside it; and the word `a·b·a·a·b·b·a·a·a·b·b·b·⋯`, its blocks growing forever,
is no lasso at all — yet `AsThenBs` is pinned by its verdicts on lassos alone.

**Finite words are solved.** For finite words, the problem of sorting all words into
finitely many bins is solved: a finite **monoid** — an associative product with a
unit — carries the bins, and a morphism `φ(uv) = φ(u)·φ(v)` does the sorting,
collapsing concatenation onto finitely many values.

On infinite words, exactly one thing more is needed — a way to say "repeat this loop
forever" — because no product of finite pieces expresses `v^ω`. Classically one
adjoins that single operation, an **ω-power** `s ↦ s^ω`, and obtains a two-sorted
**ω-semigroup** `S = (S₊, S_ω)`: `S₊` the types of finite words, `S_ω` the types of
ω-words [PP04, Ch. II]. A **recognizer** for `L` is such an `S` with a morphism
`φ : Σ^∞ → S` under which membership depends only on the type — `L = φ⁻¹(P)` for a
set `P` of accepting ω-types (that finitely many types suffice for all ω-words is
Ramsey's theorem [PP04]). We record this framing but do not carry the second sort as
a standalone algebra: §3 reads "loop forever" *inside* the finite monoid, so the
object is a finite monoid together with a set of accepting names.

*Example.* For `AsThenBs` concatenation collapses onto five values — the five boxes
of Figure 1 — and "loop forever" will be read inside those five, with no second sort.

**The idempotent power.** In a finite monoid the powers `s, s², s³, …` of any element
cannot all be distinct, so the sequence is eventually periodic and contains a unique
**idempotent**, written `s^ω` — the unique `s^n` (`n ≥ 1`) with `s^n·s^n = s^n`. Now
read a loop `v` through a recognizer's sorting map `φ`: the values of
`v, vv, vvv, …` are the powers of `φ(v)`, so they settle on the idempotent `φ(v)^ω`.
That is how "loop forever" is read without any infinite object at hand: iterate the
loop's value until it stops changing, and keep that stable value.

*Example.* On Figure 1, the value of `b` is its own idempotent power — more `b`'s
change nothing, `φ(b)·φ(b) = φ(b)`. The value of `ab` is not: its square is the value
of the *dead* words (`abab` puts an `a` after a `b`, and no continuation rescues
that), itself idempotent — so `φ(ab)^ω` is the dead value: looping `ab` forever is
exactly as dead as slipping once.

**A linked pair names a lasso.** Reading `u·v^ω` through the sorting map `φ`
(Ramsey's theorem): the loop
settles on the idempotent `e = φ(v)^ω` and the stem on `s = φ(u)·e`, with `s·e = s` (the
stem precedes the loop and is absorbed by it). A **linked pair** is any `(s, e)` with
`e² = e` and `s·e = s`; `s` names the stem, `e` the loop, `(s, e)` the lasso. A
recognizer is fixed by which lassos it accepts, hence by its set of **accepting linked
pairs** — which is why (§3) the acceptance datum of the object is a *set of pairs*, not a
subset of the monoid.

*Example.* Read `aab·b^ω` on Figure 1: the loop's value `[b]` is already idempotent,
so `e = [b]`; the stem walks `a·a·b` from the root to `[a·b]`, which the loop absorbs
(`s = [a·b]·[b] = [a·b]`). The pair `([a·b], [b])` names the lasso — as it does every
lasso with stem in `a⁺b*` and loop in `b⁺`.

**One lasso, many names.** A single ω-word has many presentations —
`u·v^ω = (uv)·v^ω = u·(v²)^ω = (u v₁)·(v₂ v₁)^ω` — and, as §3 shows, these need not name
it by the same linked pair. Reconciling them is not bookkeeping: it is the **rotation
lemma** (§3), the paper's structural pivot, and the one nontrivial constraint the object
must satisfy.

*Example.* `a·(ba)^ω = ab·(ab)^ω = ab·(abab)^ω`: one ω-word, three presentations —
and infinitely many more. §3 shows how to canonically choose a single one, and gives
it: shortest stem, then shortest loop — here `(ab)^ω` with the empty stem, the
shortlex representative of the whole family.

We now present a canonical representation of an arbitrary regular ω-language `L`,
using its syntactic ω-semigroup reified as an invariant `𝓘(L)`.

## 3. The syntactic ω-semigroup as an invariant `𝓘(L)`

The definition of the invariant

```
    𝓘(L) = ⟨𝒜, P⟩
```

splits in two parts: the **algebra** `𝒜`, a finite monoid classifying the finite
words, and the **acceptance layer** `P`, a set of accepted linked pairs carrying
acceptance. We define the algebra first.

### 3.1 The algebra `𝒜`

**Definition 3.1 (algebra).** An **algebra** `𝒜` over `Σ` is a triple `(𝒞, λ, M)`:

- `𝒞` is a finite set of **classes**, each **keyed** by a word over `Σ`, with a
  distinguished `[ε]` keyed by the empty word;
- `λ : Σ → 𝒞` is the **letter map**, giving each letter its class;
- `M : 𝒞 × 𝒞 → 𝒞` is **associative** with `[ε]` a two-sided **identity**, so `(𝒞, M)`
  is a finite monoid; write `s·t := M(s, t)`. The **fold** `⟦·⟧ : Σ* → 𝒞` — `⟦ε⟧ = [ε]`,
  `⟦w·a⟧ = ⟦w⟧·λ(a)` — extends `λ` to words, and the algebra is **letter-generated**:
  the fold is onto;
- `[ε]` is **adjoined**: `⟦w⟧ = [ε]` only for `w = ε` — no nonempty word folds to the
  identity class.

*Example.* The algebra of `AsThenBs` (§2's example) has five classes, named by their
keys — `[ε]`, `[a]`, `[b]`, `[a·b]`, `[b·a]` — with `λ(a) = [a]` and `λ(b) = [b]`.
Figure 1 is this algebra, and every label on it is a member of `𝒞`: each node a
class, each edge the class `λ(x)` of the letter it reads. The letter actions

```
 ·a :  [ε]↦[a]    [a]↦[a]     [b]↦[b·a]   [a·b]↦[b·a]   [b·a]↦[b·a]
 ·b :  [ε]↦[b]    [a]↦[a·b]   [b]↦[b]     [a·b]↦[a·b]   [b·a]↦[b·a]
```

are read off its edges, and by letter-generation these two rows are the whole of `M`:
any product `s·t` is `key(t)` walked from `s`. `[a]`
holds the words in `a⁺`, `[b]` those in `b⁺`, `[a·b]` those in `a⁺b⁺`, and `[b·a]` the
*dead* words, a two-sided **zero** (`x·[b·a] = [b·a]·x = [b·a]`): once an `a` follows a
`b`, no continuation can rescue the word.

By associativity the fold is a monoid morphism `Σ* ↠ (𝒞, M)`; two words are **equivalent
in the algebra** when they fold alike. Each class is **keyed by its shortlex-least word**
(shortest, ties alphabetical), a datum recomputable from `𝒜` by breadth-first
enumeration from `[ε]`, so the whole algebra is a canonical block of data once `M` and
`λ` are fixed. Adjoining the identity makes `[ε]` a class of its own even when the
monoid owns another neutral element: a nonempty word acting neutrally folds to its own
class, with a nonempty key — as `[a·a]` does in two of the running examples. The axiom
earns its keep in §3.2, where no accepting name may involve the empty past, and in
§5's acceptance read-off, where every accepting component must carry a nonempty key.

*Example.* `⟦aab⟧ = [a]·[a]·[b] = [a·b]`: the word `aab` folds with `ab`, and `ab` —
the shortlex-least word reaching that class — is the key. No nonempty class of this
algebra acts neutrally, so the adjunction costs nothing here; §3.5 meets an algebra
where the axiom bites.

**The idempotent power, internally.** Each class `s` has its unique idempotent power
`s^ω` (§2). This is the algebra's entire access to "loop forever": there is no second
sort — a lasso's loop is read by folding it to a class and taking that class's idempotent
power.

*Example.* `[a]`, `[b]` and `[b·a]` are their own idempotent powers; `[a·b]` is not —
`[a·b]² = [b·a]`, already idempotent, so `[a·b]^ω = [b·a]`: iterating "`a`'s then `b`'s"
forces an `a` after a `b`.

**Definition 3.2 (Cayley graph).** The **Cayley graph** of the algebra has nodes `𝒞`,
root `[ε]`, and an edge `s →^a s·λ(a)` for each `s ∈ 𝒞, a ∈ Σ`. Rooted, deterministic,
and complete — every node reached from the root along its key — it is the algebra drawn
as a machine: the right regular representation acting on itself.

*Example.* The Cayley graph of `AsThenBs` is exactly Figure 1. From `[ε]`, `a` leads
to `[a]` and `b` to `[b]`; `[a]` loops on `a` and advances to `[a·b]` on `b`; `[b]`
and `[a·b]` loop on `b` and fall to `[b·a]` on `a`; `[b·a]` absorbs both letters. Each
node sits at the end of the path spelled by its own key — the slightly thicker arrows
of the figure — and the stub marking the root stays the only arrow that ever points
at it.

The graph is the table made visible, and losslessly: any product `s·t` is read by
walking `key(t)` from `s`. The adjoined identity has a shape: the root is a
**source** — no edge enters `[ε]`, and the picture itself says the past never returns. Reachability is the
algebra's right-ideal order (here a graph falling into the dead sink), and group
content shows as a cycle traced by *repeating one word* (`s·⟦w⟧ ≠ s` yet
`s·⟦w⟧^k = s`) — none here; §3.5 draws one, and warns about the cycles that prove
nothing.

### 3.2 Naming lassos, and the rotation lemma

A **linked pair** of the algebra is `(s, e) ∈ 𝒞 × 𝒞` with `e² = e` and `s·e = s`. It
**names** every lasso `u·v^ω` with `⟦u⟧·⟦v⟧^ω = s` and `⟦v⟧^ω = e`. Loops are nonempty,
so both components of a naming pair are folds of nonempty words; since `[ε]` is
adjoined (Definition 3.1) neither is `[ε]`, so a naming pair lies in `(𝒞∖{[ε]})²`. Read as
intuition: no name may accept by staying at the start — a loop is the value of
something that happens forever, and the empty past cannot recur.

*Example.* Six linked pairs: `([a],[a])`, `([b],[b])`, `([a·b],[b])`, `([b·a],[a])`,
`([b·a],[b])`, `([b·a],[b·a])`. The pair `([a],[a])` names `a^ω` and nothing else;
`([b·a],[a])` names the lassos with a `b` somewhere, then `a`'s forever; `([a·b],[b])`
names exactly the lassos with stem in `a⁺b*` and loop in `b⁺`.

One lasso has many presentations, and — this is the subtlety the object must confront —
they need not name it by one pair. Three elementary **moves** relate the presentations of
a common ω-word:

```
    stem-extend   (u, v)      ↦ (uv, v)          [ uv·v^ω = u·v^ω ]
    loop-power    (u, v)      ↦ (u, v^k)  (k≥1)  [ (v^k)^ω = v^ω ]
    loop-rotate   (u, v₁v₂)   ↦ (uv₁, v₂v₁)      [ u(v₁v₂)^ω = uv₁(v₂v₁)^ω ]
```

On the named pair, `loop-power` changes nothing (`(⟦v⟧^k)^ω = ⟦v⟧^ω`, the idempotent
power of a power). The other two move it — and both are instances of one rotation, the
paper's pivot.

*Example.* `a·(ba)^ω ↦ ab·(ab)^ω` is a `loop-rotate`; `ab·(ab)^ω ↦ ab·(abab)^ω` a
`loop-power`. All three presentations fold to the one name `([b·a], [b·a])` — this
example's stems absorb, so its moves happen to fix the name; the lemma below is what
makes verdicts survive the moves that do not.

**Lemma 3.3 (rotation lemma).** For all `s, g, h ∈ 𝒞` with `s·(gh)^ω = s`, the linked
pairs

```
    (s, (gh)^ω)   and   (s·g, (hg)^ω)
```

name the same lassos: every ω-word named by one is named by the other.

*Proof.* By letter-generation pick words `w, p, q` with `⟦w⟧ = s`, `⟦p⟧ = g`, `⟦q⟧ = h`.
The single ω-word `w·(pq)^ω` has the presentation `(w, pq)`, named by
`(⟦w⟧·⟦pq⟧^ω, ⟦pq⟧^ω) = (s·(gh)^ω, (gh)^ω) = (s, (gh)^ω)`; and the presentation
`(wp, qp)` — the same word, since `w(pq)^ω = wp(qp)^ω` — named by
`(⟦wp⟧·⟦qp⟧^ω, ⟦qp⟧^ω) = (s·g·(hg)^ω, (hg)^ω)`. Here `g·(hg)^ω = (gh)^ω·g`, so the stem
is `s·(gh)^ω·g = s·g` (using `s·(gh)^ω = s`), and `(s·g, (hg)^ω)` is a linked pair
(`(hg)^ω` idempotent; `s·g·(hg)^ω = s·(gh)^ω·g = s·g`). Any lasso named by either pair
thus presents, by loop rotation, as one named by the other. ∎

The lemma says a loop may be **rotated** — a factor `g` carried from the loop's front
onto the stem — the loop's idempotent conjugating `(gh)^ω ↦ (hg)^ω` while the stem
absorbs `g`. `stem-extend` is the degenerate case `g = h = ⟦v⟧`: then `(gh)^ω = ⟦v⟧^ω` is
unchanged and the stem merely gains `⟦v⟧`, which is why a longer stem can name the same
lasso by a different pair. `loop-rotate` is the general case. So of the three moves, only
`loop-power` fixes the pair; every other pair-change is one rotation step.

*Example.* The degenerate case on `(a, b) ↦ (ab, b)`: the stem gains `[b]`, which
`[a·b]` absorbs — both presentations carry the name `([a·b], [b])`.

Call two linked pairs **conjugate**, `(s, e) ≈ (s', e')`, when connected by rotations —
the equivalence generated by `(s, (gh)^ω) ≈ (s·g, (hg)^ω)`. Lemma 3.3 says conjugate
pairs name the same lassos, so a recognizer must accept them together.

*Example.* All six conjugacy classes are singletons — every rotation fixes the pair,
the dead class absorbing whatever factor moves. A conjugacy that genuinely pairs two
names is worked in §3.5.

**The rotation lemma is the structural pivot of the paper.** Here it constrains the
acceptance layer (§3.3). In §7, applied not to the loop of a single lasso but to the
two-sided contexts of Arnold's syntactic congruence, the same rotation carries a *left*
context around the loop into a *right* extension at a shifted starting point — collapsing
the two-sided congruence to a right-invariant refinement, computable by the one operation
a monoid's table offers for free. That collapse is the construction's core; it is
Lemma 3.3 read at the level of contexts, and §7 only instantiates it.

### 3.3 The acceptance layer, and well-definedness

**Definition 3.4 (acceptance layer; object).** An **acceptance layer** over an algebra
`𝒜` is a set `P` of linked pairs that is **saturated** — closed under conjugacy:

```
    (s, (gh)^ω) ∈ P  ⟺  (s·g, (hg)^ω) ∈ P     for all s, g, h ∈ 𝒞 with s·(gh)^ω = s.
```

An **object** is a pair `𝓘 = ⟨𝒜, P⟩`: an algebra and an acceptance layer over it. Saturation is a finite, mechanical closure — checkable directly on the
multiplication table, with no automaton and no external theory (§3.5 verifies it by hand
on the examples).

*Example.* `P = { ([b],[b]), ([a·b],[b]) }` — the two behaviors of `a*·b^ω`: "reading
`b`'s after nothing but `a`'s (if any), keep reading `b`'s". Saturation is immediate,
each pair being its own conjugacy class (§3.2). The flip `P^c` — the other four linked
pairs — is an equally legal layer, and denotes the complement (§4).

**The membership query.** Given a lasso `u·v^ω`, the object answers membership by folding
and one lookup:

```
    e := ⟦v⟧^ω,   s := ⟦u⟧·e,   accept  u·v^ω  ⟺  (s, e) ∈ P.
```

`(s, e)` is a linked pair (`e² = e`; `s·e = ⟦u⟧·e·e = s`) — the pair naming `u·v^ω`.

*Example.* Three runs. `b^ω`: the loop `[b]` is already idempotent, the empty stem
gives `s = [ε]·[b] = [b]`; `([b],[b]) ∈ P` — accepted. `aab·b^ω`: `⟦aab⟧ = [a·b]`,
loop `[b]`; `([a·b],[b]) ∈ P` — accepted. `a·(ab)^ω`: `⟦ab⟧ = [a·b]` is *not*
idempotent — the table refuses `ab` as a stable block; iterate to `[a·b]^ω = [b·a]`,
then `s = [a]·[b·a] = [b·a]` and `([b·a],[b·a]) ∉ P` — rejected, the idempotent-power
step visibly doing the work: the loop `ab` keeps producing an `a` after a `b`.

**Lemma 3.5 (well-definedness).** The query's verdict on `u·v^ω` depends only on the
ω-word, not on the presentation `(u, v)`, **iff** `P` is saturated.

*Proof.* (⇐) Two presentations of one ω-word are connected by the three moves
(Lemma 3.6). `loop-power` leaves the named pair, hence the verdict, unchanged;
`stem-extend` and `loop-rotate` change it by one conjugacy step, which preserves
`P`-membership by saturation. The verdict is thus constant along any chain connecting two
presentations. (⇒) Fix `s, g, h` with `s·(gh)^ω = s`; the cases `g = [ε]` or `h = [ε]`
are trivial (both pairs coincide), so take `g, h ≠ [ε]`. Then `s ≠ [ε]` (else
`s = s·(gh)^ω = (gh)^ω`, but `(gh)^ω` is a fold of nonempty words and `[ε]` is
adjoined). Letter-generation realizes `s, g, h` by words, and Lemma 3.3's two
presentations of the one word `w(pq)^ω` carry the pairs `(s, (gh)^ω)` and
`(s·g, (hg)^ω)`. Presentation-independence forces one verdict, i.e. both pairs lie in `P`
or neither. ∎

*Example.* Presentation-independence is immediate here — singleton conjugacy classes;
§3.5's saturation check shows the ⇒ direction biting on a `P` that would answer `a^ω`
two ways.

**Lemma 3.6 (presentations connect).** Two presentations name the same ω-word iff
connected by `stem-extend`, `loop-power`, `loop-rotate` and their inverses.

*Proof.* (⇐) Each move preserves the ω-word (the identities beside the moves). (⇒) Reduce
any `(u, v)` to a canonical presentation of `α := u·v^ω` fixed by `α` alone. Let `π` be
the least eventual period of `α` and `t` its least pre-period (`α` is `π`-periodic from
position `t`, both minimal). As `v^ω` is the tail of `α` from position `|u|`, `v` is a
power of the length-`π` rotation `ρ` of the primitive period beginning at position `|u|`;
`loop-power`⁻¹ takes `v = ρ`. If `|u| > t`, the last letter of `u` lies in the periodic
part and is the letter `ρ` continues with, so `loop-rotate`⁻¹ pulls it into the loop,
lowering `|u|` by one and rotating `ρ`; iterate to `|u| = t`. The result — the length-`t`
prefix of `α` and the period rotated to begin at `t` — depends only on `α`, so any two
presentations reduce to it. ∎

*Example.* `(aab, bb)` reduces: `loop-power`⁻¹ to `(aab, b)`; the stem's last letter
`b` lies in the periodic part, so `loop-rotate`⁻¹ pulls it in, giving `(aa, b)` — the
canonical presentation (`t = 2`, `π = 1`), reached from any presentation of `aab·b^ω`.

By Lemma 3.5 a saturated `P` makes the query a function of the ω-word. Read as a
recognizer, the object accepts exactly the lassos of a unique regular ω-language
`L(𝓘)` — agreement on lassos determining a regular ω-language (§2) — and this is the
language the object denotes.

*Example.* The two accepting names admit exactly the lassos with stem in `a*b*` and
loop in `b⁺` — the lassos of `a*·b^ω`, and no others: `L(𝓘) = L`.

### 3.4 Residuals are derived data

Started at any class, the object answers membership of a residual.

**Proposition 3.7 (residuals).** For `s ∈ 𝒞` set
`L_s := { y·t^ω : (s·⟦y⟧·⟦t⟧^ω, ⟦t⟧^ω) ∈ P }` — the query run from `s` — with
`L_{[ε]} = L(𝓘)`. Then each `L_{s·λ(a)} = a⁻¹L_s`, residual equality is right-invariant
(`L_s = L_{s'} ⟹ L_{s·λ(a)} = L_{s'·λ(a)}`), and the residual automaton is a quotient of
the Cayley graph — all recomputable from `⟨𝒜, P⟩`.

*Proof.* `L_{s·λ(a)} = a⁻¹L_s` is immediate from the fold:
`y·t^ω ∈ L_{s·λ(a)} ⟺ (s·λ(a)·⟦y⟧·⟦t⟧^ω, ⟦t⟧^ω) ∈ P ⟺ (s·⟦a·y⟧·⟦t⟧^ω, ⟦t⟧^ω) ∈ P
⟺ a·y·t^ω ∈ L_s`. Right-invariance follows, so quotienting the Cayley graph (Def 3.2) by
residual equality yields a deterministic, complete letter-graph — the residual
automaton. ∎

*Example.* `L_{[a]} = a⁻¹L = L` (the `a*` absorbs); `L_{[b]} = L_{[a·b]} = {b^ω}`;
`L_{[b·a]} = ∅`. The five-node Cayley graph quotients to a three-state residual
automaton — `{[ε],[a]}`, `{[b],[a·b]}`, `{[b·a]}` — strictly coarser than the algebra:
the residuals cannot tell `[b]` from `[a·b]`, the two-sided congruence can.

No congruence and no automaton is invoked. The residuals are derived data and rightly
enter no equality test between objects (§5).

### 3.5 Concrete form, read on the examples

Recall the three running examples (introduced fully in §1): **`GF(aa)`** — infinitely
many `aa`-factors, LTL-definable; **`Even`** — an even number of `a`'s before the first
`b`, then anything, *not* LTL; **`EvenBlocks`** — infinitely many `b` and eventually
every completed `a`-block even, *not* LTL and prefix-independent. Each is met here as
its algebra — the letter actions, the few laws that organize them, and the Cayley
graph drawn; automata wait until §6, the machine formats (serialization, integer
tables) until Part B. In all
three, `λ(a) = [a]` and `λ(b) = [b]`, and letter-generation makes the two action rows
the whole of `M`.

**(a) `GF(aa)`** — six classes:

```
 ·a :  [ε]↦[a]    [a]↦[a·a]   [b]↦[b·a]   [a·b]↦[a]     [b·a]↦[a·a]   [a·a]↦[a·a]
 ·b :  [ε]↦[b]    [a]↦[a·b]   [b]↦[b]     [a·b]↦[a·b]   [b·a]↦[b]     [a·a]↦[a·a]
```

Laws: `[a·a]` — "has seen `aa`" — is a two-sided **zero**
(`x·[a·a] = [a·a]·x = [a·a]`); every power cycle has period 1 — aperiodic, the LTL
side of the cut; the idempotents are `[b]`, `[a·b]`, `[b·a]`, `[a·a]`, with
`[a]^ω = [a·a]`. One accepting pair, `P = { ([a·a],[a·a]) }`: hit the zero and loop
there — `aa` recurs.

![Figure 2 — the object of GF(aa)](sos_core_figs/img/core_F1_gf_aa.png)

*Figure 2 — `GF(aa)`. Two waiting rooms — `[a] ⇄ [a·b]` and `[b] ⇄ [b·a]`, cycles
that mix letters, hence no group — each escaping on `a` toward the zero; the one
accepting name loops at the zero itself.*

**(b) `Even`** — five classes:

```
 ·a :  [ε]↦[a]    [a]↦[a·a]   [b]↦[b]     [a·b]↦[a·b]   [a·a]↦[a]
 ·b :  [ε]↦[b]    [a]↦[a·b]   [b]↦[b]     [a·b]↦[a·b]   [a·a]↦[b]
```

Laws: `{[a], [a·a]}` is a **period-2 cycle** (`[a]·[a] = [a·a]`, `[a·a]·[a] = [a]`) — a
`Z₂` in the algebra, visible in the `·a` row as the swap `[a] ↔ [a·a]`. `[a·a]` acts as
the **identity** on the four word classes: the algebra owns a second neutral element,
and the adjoined identity of §3.1 keeps `[ε]` apart. `[b]` and `[a·b]` are
**left zeros**, fixed by both letters: the first `b` has been read, after an even
(`[b]`) or odd (`[a·b]`) count of `a`'s. Accepting pairs `([b],[b])`, `([b],[a·a])`,
`([b],[a·b])`: once `[b]` is reached, every loop accepts.

![Figure 3 — the object of Even](sos_core_figs/img/core_F2_even.png)

*Figure 3 — `Even`. The diagonal `[a] ⇄ [a·a]`, both legs on the single letter
`a`, is a monochrome two-cycle — the `Z₂` drawn; every accepting name stems at
`[b]`.*

**(c) `EvenBlocks`** — eight classes:

```
 ·a :  [ε]↦[a]       [a]↦[a·a]    [b]↦[b·a]        [a·b]↦[a·b·a]
       [b·a]↦[b]     [a·a]↦[a]    [a·b·a]↦[a·b]    [b·a·b]↦[b·a·b]
 ·b :  [ε]↦[b]       [a]↦[a·b]    [b]↦[b]          [a·b]↦[a·b]
       [b·a]↦[b·a·b] [a·a]↦[b]    [a·b·a]↦[b·a·b]  [b·a·b]↦[b·a·b]
```

Laws: the *same* `Z₂` `{[a], [a·a]}` returns, and `[a·a]` is again neutral on the word
classes; `[b·a·b]` — a completed odd block — is the two-sided **zero**. Unlike
`AsThenBs`'s dead class, this zero is no death sentence: the language forgives finitely
many odd blocks, and the acceptance layer says so — of the six accepting pairs

```
P = { ([b],[b]),  ([a·b],[b]),  ([b·a],[a·b·a]),
      ([a·b·a],[a·b·a]),  ([b·a·b],[b]),  ([b·a·b],[a·b·a]) }
```

two sit at the zero itself: what has happened is absorbed; what loops forever decides.

![Figure 4 — the object of EvenBlocks](sos_core_figs/img/core_F3_evenblocks.png)

*Figure 4 — `EvenBlocks`. The same `Z₂` acting as three `·a` swaps — one per
phase of the language — and two accepting names sitting at the zero.*

---

**Reading the object by hand.** Three checks, all on the letter actions above and none
touching an automaton.

*Membership by one fold.* Is `(a·a)^ω ∈ Even`? Fold the loop: `[ε] ↦ [a] ↦ [a·a]`,
already idempotent; the empty stem gives `s = [ε]·[a·a] = [a·a]`. The pair
`([a·a], [a·a])` is not among `Even`'s accepting pairs, so it is rejected — correctly,
`(aa)^ω` never sees a `b`.

*The group is on the table.* In `Even`, `[a]·[a] = [a·a]` and `[a·a]·[a] = [a]`: the
pair `{[a], [a·a]}` is a cycle of period 2, a `Z₂` sitting in the algebra. Since (as §5
makes exact) aperiodicity of the algebra is LTL-definability, this cycle *is* the
reason `Even` is not LTL — read straight off the letter actions, before any acceptance
is consulted. `GF(aa)`'s algebra, by contrast, has every power-cycle of period 1:
aperiodic, hence LTL. In the drawing the criterion is a *monochrome* cycle — one
letter (more generally one word) repeated, as `Even`'s `·a` swap between `[a]` and
`[a·a]` (Figure 3). A cycle that mixes letters proves nothing: `GF(aa)`'s graph
closes `[a] →^b [a·b] →^a [a]` (Figure 2's waiting rooms), and its algebra is
aperiodic all the same.

*Saturation, checked.* The query on `a^ω` presented two ways must agree, and does:
`(ε, a)` folds to the pair `([ε]·[a]^ω, [a]^ω) = ([a·a], [a·a])`, while `(a, a)` folds
to `([a]·[a·a], [a·a]) = ([a], [a·a])` — a conjugacy step
`(s, (gh)^ω) ≈ (s·g, (hg)^ω)` with `s = g = h = [a]`. Both pairs are absent from
`Even`'s accepting set, as saturation (Definition 3.4) demands; a `P` containing one
but not the other would be an *illegal* acceptance layer, its query self-contradictory
on the single word `a^ω`.

## 4. What the object unlocks

- Identity band, near-free from the semantics: equality is byte equality of canonical
  serializations, complement is `P ↦ P^c`, emptiness is `P = ∅`, membership is one fold.
- Flagship read-off: LTL-definability is aperiodicity of the table — power-iterate each
  class, look for a cycle of period ≥ 2 (current §7.1, compressed).
- The taxonomy table (current §7.2) condensed: one sentence per row, each a structural
  test on the same object, several with no practical tool today.
- The suggestion, one paragraph: wherever a pipeline step is language-level, the
  automaton is a proxy and the canonical object can take its place — the calculus
  companion develops this.
- Nothing here is developed; this section motivates Part B and points at the family.

## 5. Canonicity

- Arnold's syntactic congruence recalled in full, with the two context shapes (current
  §2 block, moved here).
- The two shapes are genuinely independent — `Even` vs `EvenBlocks`, current Prop 4.6
  and examples.
- The syntactic object: the quotient by Arnold's congruence, keyed shortlex, is a
  well-formed `⟨𝒜, P⟩` and a function of `L` alone.
- Complete invariant theorem (current Thm 5.1): two languages are equal iff their
  objects are byte-equal.
- Two minimality senses, both exact: coarsest congruence saturating `L` (Arnold);
  unique canonical complete invariant. (Minimal-recognizer claim dropped.)
- The two shapes double as the specification the construction must meet — hand-off
  to Part B.

## 6. The construction, I: seeing acceptance

- The input: any deterministic complete Emerson–Lei automaton `D` (current §2 automaton
  block, moved here).
- The first obstruction: the transition monoid forgets the marks acceptance reads.
- The acceptance-enriched monoid `EM(D)` (current Def 3.1) and the skeleton lemma
  (current Lemma 3.2).
- Necessity (current Prop 3.4): the one-state witness with trivial transition monoid
  under a nontrivial language.
- The enriched monoids of the three examples (current Table 2).

## 7. The construction, II: the rotation lemma

- The second obstruction: Arnold's congruence is two-sided, but a monoid's closure
  table offers only right multiplication.
- The collapse (current Lemma 4.1): a prefix acts only through the single state it
  reaches — evaluation factors through a finite left action on slots.
- The rotation lemma, stated at its natural generality: a left factor acts on a
  two-sided context only by re-indexing the slot — `a·e·b` at slot `q` equals `e·b·a`
  at slot `st_a(q)` — so the two-sided congruence is the coarsest right-invariant
  refinement of a slot-indexed seed; three-line proof.
- Discussion, factual: MS97 displayed the finitary × infinitary split with two-sided
  quantification still inside the loop; CPP08 saturated over context triples; the
  conjugation `a·e·b ↦ e·b·a` is the step neither took.
- Template remarks, only what we have: the right-extension-at-slots discipline is
  exactly an observation-table discipline (AF21's obstruction answered), and the
  one-sided fixpoint is what a symbolic implementation computes.
- Instantiation on `EM(D)`: `~lin` (residual equality at reached slots) and `~ω`
  (right-invariant profile equality), current Def 4.2 and Prop 4.3; the worked
  `EvenBlocks` split.

## 8. The algorithm and the two theorems

- Moore partition refinement from the seed `R = (~lin-class, Aprof)`, split by right
  letters to fixpoint (current Thm 4.5's procedure).
- Reading `P` off `D`: test one shortlex lasso per candidate linked pair.
- NEW — Theorem A (correctness, self-contained): `𝓘(D)` is well-formed (saturation
  proved, not assumed) and `L(𝓘(D)) = L(D)`; proof from the skeleton lemma and the
  collapse only, no Arnold.
- Theorem B (canonicity): `𝓘(D)` is the syntactic object of §5 — the constructed
  quotient is Arnold's.
- Examples resolved: `GF(aa)`'s presentation group dies in the quotient (10 → 6, LTL);
  `Even` and `EvenBlocks` keep a genuine `Z₂`.
- Canonicity exhibited (current Fig 3): two non-isomorphic presentations of `GF(aa)`,
  byte-identical output.

## 9. Complexity

- Two costs, currently blurred, now split: the object is quadratic in `|𝒞|`; the
  construction path through `EM(D)` is exponential in `|Q|` in the worst case.
- `|𝒞|` is a language invariant — the intrinsic complexity of `L`; PSPACE-hardness of
  the aperiodicity question says some exponential is unavoidable.
- Everything after construction is polynomial in the table (current §8 read-off claims).
- BDD-friendliness note kept: all ingredients Boolean, all steps set operations.

## 10. Related work

- Arnold (the congruence), MS97 (the display), CPP08 (the recognizer, saturation over
  triples), PP04 (the algebraic frame), Wilke, DG08 (decidability without an algebra),
  AF16/AF21/ABF18 (the learning obstruction the rotation lemma addresses).
- Positioning sentence per item: what each had, what each lacked toward the object.

## 11. Conclusion

- The object was never built because two structural pieces were missing; both are
  supplied, and `⟨𝒜, P⟩` is the deliverable.
- The rotation lemma stands on its own as the mathematical core.
- The family builds on `⟨𝒜, P⟩`: companions consume the object this paper defines
  and constructs.

## Not transferred (parked, decide later)

- Current §6 (finite-word specialization, LTLf) — at most a one-line degeneration
  remark somewhere in Part B if we want the sanity check.
- Current §7 use-case development beyond the §4 teaser — lives in the companion papers.
- No prospects beyond material we have (no prophetic extraction, no learning-paper
  promises beyond the two factual template remarks in §7).
