# SoS Quantitative (Measure / Distance / Entropy) — Implementation Specification

**Status (2026-07-11).**

| item | state |
|---|---|
| **M1: θ-profile + measure + fixture/flip gate (§1–§6)** | **DONE (2026-07-11)** — `sosl/sosl/quant/` (placement provisional), fixtures exact, flip gate 4248/4248 green, `reference/quant/m1_measure.{md,csv}`, finding F-M1 |
| M2 = QNT2: Route A oracle + metamorphic harness (§8) | **OPEN — the current work order; §8 is self-contained** |
| M3 = QNT1c: distance on aligned tables (§9) | LATER — needs M1 |
| M4 = QNT3: entropy (§10) | LATER — independent of M2/M3 |
| M5 = QNT4: the Markov product `Pr_M(L)` (§11) | LATER — needs M1+M2 |
| M6 = QNT5: census campaign + pipeline demo (§12) | LAST |
| MDPs, semiring-valued `Val`, Hausdorff dimension, performance work | **NON-GOALS** (§13) |

An implementer starting cold for M2 reads: §0 and §8 of this file, plus
the §2 module map for what M1 provides. Do not read `docs/HISTORY.md`.
Do not start M3–M6. (§1–§6 remain the normative description of the M1
engine they would be extending.)

**Normative math.** `research_notes/sos_measure.md` (the paper):
Lemmas 3.1–3.3, Theorem 3.4, and the §4.1 algorithm are what M1
implements. Where this spec and the paper disagree, the paper wins and
the disagreement is a bug to report in `sos_measure_report.md`.

## 0. Ground rules (read first, they are all mandatory)

- **Package**: new code goes in `sosl/sosl/sos/quant/` (create it, with
  `__init__.py`). Test scripts go in `sosl/tests/quant/`. Logs go in
  `sosl/tests/quant/logs/` (create; never `/tmp`).
- **Layering (hard)**: `sosl.sos.quant` imports `sosl.sos` and
  `sosl.sos.calculus` and NOTHING else in the repo — never `sosl.learn`,
  `sosl.teacher`, `sosl.experiment`, `tests.*`. Do not modify any
  existing file outside `sosl/sosl/sos/quant/` and `sosl/tests/quant/`.
- **Reuse, don't re-derive.** The invariant object, its `.sos` reader,
  `fold`, `idem`, `Val`, the linked-pair enumeration, and the complement
  surgery all exist. Find them under `sosl/sosl/sos/` (`invariant.py`,
  `io/`, `calculus/table.py`, `calculus/surgery.py`) — grep for `idem`,
  `Val`, `complement`, `linked`. If a right-Cayley SCC pass already
  exists (the obligation read-off uses one — grep `scc` under
  `calculus/`), reuse it; only if absent, implement Tarjan locally in
  `quant/`.
- **Numbers are `fractions.Fraction`, end to end.** No `float` anywhere
  in M1. No numpy. No Spot. No subprocess.
- **Type every signature** (params + return), `from __future__ import
  annotations` allowed; follow the typing style of the calculus package.
- **Tests are placed scripts** run as `python3 -m tests.quant.<name>`
  from `sosl/`, one input per invocation where a corpus is walked
  (argv = one `.sos` path), ≤15s per case; a blown budget is a finding
  to report, not something to code around.
- **Files stay under ~500 LOC.** Split by the module layout of §2.
- Every public function gets a context-free docstring: what the
  function computes on its own inputs — not who calls it, not the
  campaign it serves.

## 1. M1 scope — one sentence

From a held invariant `𝓘 = (𝒞, λ, M, P)`: compute the **θ-profile**
(one canonical bit per bottom SCC of the right-Cayley graph) and the
**measure** `μ_p(L)` as an exact `Fraction`, certificate included;
prove it on three hand-computed fixtures and one corpus-wide exact law.
Nothing else — no distance, no entropy, no Markov chains, no Spot
oracle, no census columns.

## 2. M1 work order (do the steps in this order)

1. `quant/chain.py` — bottom SCCs of the right-Cayley graph (§3.1).
2. `quant/kernel.py` — one kernel idempotent of `S` (§3.2).
3. `quant/theta.py` — the θ-profile (§3.3).
4. `quant/measure.py` — the linear system and `measure()` (§3.4).
5. `tests/quant/fixtures.py` — the three fixtures of §4, exact
   expected values, plus the in-engine paranoid checks of §5.
6. `tests/quant/flip_gate.py` — the corpus-wide flip law (§6).
7. One machine report `reference/quant/m1_measure.{md,csv}` and one
   finding row appended to `research_notes/sos_measure_report.md`
   (regeneration command included). Stop; hand back.

## 3. M1 algorithms (explicit)

Notation: classes are whatever id type the invariant uses; `[ε]` is the
adjoined identity (the io layer knows it); `S = 𝒞 \ {[ε]}` as a vertex
set (every non-identity class is the fold of some nonempty word, and no
nonempty word folds to `[ε]` — assert this by checking `λ(a) ≠ [ε]` for
all `a`).

### 3.1 `chain.py`

```python
def right_cayley_edges(inv: Inv) -> dict[C, list[C]]      # c -> [M(c, λ(a)) for a in Σ]
def bottom_sccs(inv: Inv) -> list[frozenset[C]]
```

SCCs of the graph on ALL of `𝒞` (including `[ε]`); a bottom SCC is one
with no edge leaving it. Return them sorted by their least class key
(shortlex on `key(c)` — the invariant carries the keys; this fixed
order is what makes the θ-profile canonical). Assert: `[ε]` is in no
bottom SCC (its SCC is the singleton `{[ε]}` with no return edge);
at least one bottom SCC exists.

### 3.2 `kernel.py`

```python
def kernel_idempotent(inv: Inv) -> C
```

Build the two-sided Cayley graph on `S` only: edges `c → M(λ(a), c)`
AND `c → M(c, λ(a))` for every `a ∈ Σ`. Compute its SCCs; keep the
*sink* SCCs (no edge leaving). **Assert exactly one sink** — it is the
kernel `K` (unique minimal two-sided ideal); two sinks mean a corrupted
table: raise, do not continue. Take `t` = the least-keyed element of
`K`, return `k := idem(t)` (reuse the existing `idem`). Assert
`M(k, k) = k` and `k ∈ K`.

### 3.3 `theta.py`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ThetaProfile:
    entries: tuple[tuple[str, bool], ...]   # (least class key of the SCC, θ) in §3.1 order

def theta_profile(inv: Inv) -> ThetaProfile
```

For each bottom SCC `C`: pick its least-keyed class `c`, compute
`θ_C := Val(c, k)` with `k` from §3.2 — reuse the existing `Val`
(`Val(c, k) = ((M(c, k), k) ∈ P)`; `k` is idempotent so `idem(k) = k`).
One lookup per component.

### 3.4 `measure.py`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MeasureResult:
    value: Fraction
    profile: ThetaProfile
    absorption: tuple[tuple[str, Fraction], ...]  # per bottom SCC, §3.1 order

def uniform(inv: Inv) -> dict[Letter, Fraction]
def measure(inv: Inv, p: dict[Letter, Fraction] | None = None) -> MeasureResult
```

Validate `p` (every letter present, every value `> 0`, sum `== 1` —
exact Fraction comparisons); default `uniform`. Let `theta[C]` be the
§3.3 bits. Let `transient` = classes in no bottom SCC. Unknowns `x_c`
for `c ∈ transient`; for each transient `c`, the equation

```
x_c  =  Σ_{a ∈ Σ} p(a) · rhs(M(c, λ(a)))
rhs(c') = x_{c'}            if c' transient
        = θ_{C(c')}         if c' lies in bottom SCC C(c')
```

i.e. move the unknown terms left, the constant terms right, and solve
the `|transient| × |transient|` system by plain Gaussian elimination
over `Fraction` (write it by hand, ~40 lines; no library). The matrix
is nonsingular — from every transient class a bottom SCC is reachable —
so a zero pivot after full row-search is an assertion failure, not a
case to handle. `value = x_[ε]`. Also compute, for the certificate,
the absorption probability of each bottom SCC (same system with
boundary 1 on that SCC, 0 on the others — or solve once with vector
right-hand sides, implementer's choice; assert the absorptions sum to
1 exactly).

Complement note (needed by §6): `measure` must accept an invariant
whose `P` was flipped by the existing calculus complement surgery
WITHOUT any reduce — nothing in §3.1–§3.4 assumes the table is
syntactic-minimal. Do not call `reduce` anywhere in M1.

## 4. M1 fixtures (hand-checked ground truth; exact equality required)

Build these three invariants in-test (construct the object directly, or
write three tiny `.sos` files under `tests/quant/`; whichever the io
layer makes easier). Alphabet `Σ = {a, b}` in all three. Classes are
named by their shortlex key.

**F-A: L = "infinitely many a's".** Classes `[ε]`, `A` (key `a`:
words containing an `a`), `B` (key `b`: nonempty all-`b` words).
`λ(a) = A`, `λ(b) = B`. Table: `A·A = A·B = B·A = A`, `B·B = B`
(identity rows/columns for `[ε]`). `P = {(A, A)}`.
Expected: bottom SCCs = `[{A}]`; kernel `K = {A}`, `k = A`;
θ-profile `[("a", 1)]`; `μ = 1` — for uniform `p` AND for
`p(a) = 1/3` (exactly `Fraction(1)`).

**F-B: L = "finitely many a's".** Same table; `P = {(A, B), (B, B)}`
(the complement's accepting linked pairs). Expected: θ-profile
`[("a", 0)]`; `μ = 0` under both `p`'s. (Also obtainable from F-A by
the complement surgery — assert both routes give byte-equal results.)

**F-C: L = a·Σ^ω ("first letter a").** Classes `[ε]`, `A` (key `a`:
words starting `a`), `B` (key `b`: words starting `b`). `λ(a) = A`,
`λ(b) = B`. Table: `A·x = A`, `B·x = B` for `x ∈ {A, B}`.
`P = {(A, A), (A, B)}`. Expected: bottom SCCs = `[{A}, {B}]`; the
kernel is ALL of `S = {A, B}` (single sink SCC of the two-sided graph
— check this is what §3.2 finds), so `k ∈ {A, B}` — **assert the
θ-profile is the same for both choices** (this exercises paper
Lemma 3.3): `[("a", 1), ("b", 0)]`. `μ = 1/2` uniform;
`μ = 1/3` for `p(a) = 1/3`. Absorption: `[("a", p(a)), ("b", p(b))]`.

If any fixture disagrees with the code, the code is wrong until proven
otherwise; if you believe the fixture itself is wrong, STOP and report
in `sos_measure_report.md` — that is a finding against the paper.

## 5. M1 in-engine paranoid checks

Behind a module-level flag `PARANOID: bool = True` (leave it on in M1;
the census pass may later sample it):

- θ recomputed from a *different* class of the same bottom SCC agrees
  (paper Lemma 3.3(1)).
- θ recomputed with `k' := idem(t')` for a *different* `t'` in the
  kernel (when `|K| > 1`) agrees (paper Lemma 3.3(2)).
- `Σ_C absorption(C) = 1` exactly.
- `[ε]` transient; profile length = number of bottom SCCs.

Each failure raises with the invariant's identifying key in the
message.

## 6. M1 gate: the flip law, corpus-wide

`tests/quant/flip_gate.py`, argv = one `.sos` path from
`genaut/corpus/flat_canon/`; a driver mode `--list` may emit the file
list for a shell loop, but the measurement path handles ONE file per
invocation. For the given invariant: load, `measure` under uniform
`p`; complement via the existing calculus flip (no reduce); `measure`
again; **check `μ(L) + μ(¬L) == 1` exactly** and that the two
θ-profiles are pointwise negations. Write one CSV row per case
(`name, n, n_bottom_sccs, mu_num, mu_den, ok, ms`) under
`tests/quant/logs/`, aggregate into `reference/quant/m1_measure.{md,csv}`
with the date / git-rev / corpus header used by `reference/calculus/`
reports (copy that header shape).

**M1 is DONE when:** fixtures F-A/F-B/F-C pass exactly (both `p`'s);
the flip gate is green on the full census (any red row = stop and
report); the report files exist with the regeneration command; no
float, no Spot, no reduce, layering respected. Then hand back for
review — do not begin M2.

---

## 7. Milestone sections — M2 (§8) is the work order; §9–§12 reference only

## 8. M2 (QNT2) — Route A oracle + metamorphic harness

The ground rules of §0 stand (exact `Fraction`s in every verdict path,
placed scripts, one input per invocation, ≤15s per case, ~500 LOC
files, context-free docstrings, layering), with one relaxation: **Spot
is allowed in M2 for parsing and acceptance read-out only** — never for
construction, always bounded-or-skipped; a skip is a datum, never a
wait. New code continues in the M1 package (`quant/`), new tests in
`tests/quant/`.

### 8.1 Scope — one sentence

An independent measure oracle on each census language's paired
deterministic automaton, plus four exact laws that test θ where the
flip law is blind (see the F-M1 theory reply in
`sos_measure_report.md`), corpus-wide.

### 8.2 Work order

1. `quant/routea.py` — the oracle (§8.3).
2. `tests/quant/oracle_gate.py` — law L1, one corpus `.sos` per
   invocation (its `det/` mate found by basename).
3. `tests/quant/law_gate.py` — laws L2–L4 on sampled aligned pairs
   (argv = two `.sos` paths), law L5 on obligation-band rows (argv =
   one `.sos` path).
4. Machine report `reference/quant/m2_oracle.{md,csv}` (date / git-rev
   / seed / corpus header) and finding row(s) in
   `sos_measure_report.md`, regeneration commands included. Stop; hand
   back.

### 8.3 Route A (the oracle)

Substrate: the corpus pairs every `sos/X.sos` with `det/X.hoa` — a
deterministic, **complete** automaton with Emerson–Lei acceptance on
transitions, same basename ⟺ same language. On it, under a
full-support rational `p` on the letter masks:

- The automaton states are the chain states; `δ(q, a)` is unique, so
  the transition probability `q → q'` is the exact `Fraction`
  `Σ { p(a) : δ(q, a) = q' }`.
- Bottom SCCs of that chain (the BSCCs), same pass shape as §3.1.
- A run absorbed in a BSCC `B` a.s. traverses **every** edge of `B`
  infinitely often (finite irreducible chain, every edge positive), so
  the run accepts iff the EL condition evaluates true on the mark set
  of `B`'s edges: `Inf(m)` ⟺ `m` occurs on some `B`-edge, `Fin(m)` ⟺
  it occurs on none. One evaluation per BSCC (Spot exposes the parsed
  acceptance condition; evaluate it on the mark set, e.g.
  `acc.accepting(marks)`).
- The §3.4 transient system with these BSCC bits as boundary;
  `μ_A = x_{init}`. Reuse the M1 solver — do not write a second one.

Spot's role ends at parsing the HOA and exposing the acceptance
formula. A parse failure or blown budget is a recorded skip.
Assert the HOA's AP set matches the invariant's alphabet.

### 8.4 The laws

- **L1 — oracle agreement (corpus-wide):** `measure(𝓘(X)).value ==
  μ_A(det/X.hoa)` exactly, under uniform `p` AND one fixed skewed `p`
  (`p(a) ∝ 1 + rank(a)`, normalized; rank = letter mask value). Per
  file, both `p`'s in one invocation.
- **L2 — modularity (sampled aligned pairs):** on one aligned table,
  `μ(P₁|P₂) + μ(P₁&P₂) == μ(P₁) + μ(P₂)` exactly (free surgeries `|`
  and `&`; `measure` runs on the aligned, non-reduced table — M1
  supports this by construction).
- **L3 — monotonicity (same aligned pairs):** if the calculus
  `included` says `L₁ ⊆ L₂` then `μ(L₁) ≤ μ(L₂)`.
- **L4 — trichotomy `p`-freeness:** 3 random full-support rational
  `p` per file, fixed seed recorded in the report header: the
  0 / interior / 1 trichotomy of `μ_p` equals the profile read-off
  (all-0 / mixed / all-1) for every `p`.
- **L5 — obligation cross-check:** on census rows whose `.cat` sidecar
  lies in the obligation band: for every bottom SCC `C`, `θ_C` equals
  the constant stem verdict of `C`'s linked stems (the calculus
  paper's Thm 3.10, made numerical) — an independent θ check that
  needs no automaton at all.

Sampling for L2/L3: the first-1000-uniform-pairs precedent of
`reference/calculus/v1_*`; one pair per invocation.

### 8.5 M2 is DONE when

L1 is green (or skipped-with-datum, skip rate reported) on the full
census under both `p`'s; L2–L5 green on their samples; the report
files exist with regeneration commands; any red row = stop and report.
Then hand back — do not begin M3/M4.

Fixture additions (F-D, F-E) — promote the paper's two worked examples,
hand-verified there: **F-D** = "some `a` at infinitely many even
positions" (paper §3.4 example: 8 non-identity classes `(p, E)`,
kernel `≅ ℤ/2`, `k = fold(aa)`, `μ = 1` for every full-support `p`;
also assert the *negative control*: for the non-kernel idempotent
`e' = fold(ba)`, `Val(fold(b), e') = 1 ≠ 0 = Val(fold(bb), e')` — the
engine must NOT use non-kernel idempotents). **F-E** = "`b` occurs and
the first `b` is at an even position" (paper §4.1 example: 5 classes,
kernel spans two bottom SCCs, `μ = p_b/(1−p_a²)`: exactly
`Fraction(2, 3)` at uniform, `Fraction(3, 4)` at `p_a = 1/3`).

## 9. M3 (QNT1c) — distance + the measure shadow

`d_p(L₁, L₂)`: align (calculus), `xor` the carried pair sets, run M1's
`measure` on the aligned table. Return `Fraction` plus the aligned
xor's θ-profile (all-zero ⟺ null disagreement — paper §4.2).
Pseudometric laws sampled: symmetry exact, triangle on sampled
triples, `d_p(L, L) = 0`.

**Shadow surgery** (paper Prop 4.1): `shadow(inv) -> Inv` replaces the
pair set by `P_sh := {(s, e) ∈ linked : s ∈ D}`, `D` = union of the
θ=1 bottom SCCs (M1 already computes both ingredients), then `reduce`.
Laws, all exact:

- `d_p(L, shadow(L)) = 0` (aligned xor-profile all-zero), on fixtures
  and corpus samples;
- idempotence: `shadow(shadow(L))` byte-equal `shadow(L)`;
- `p`-freeness: shadow bytes identical under 3 random full-support `p`
  (trivially true — the construction never reads `p`; assert anyway);
- **F-F (positive)**: `shadow` of F-A ("infinitely many `a`'s") is
  byte-equal to the reduced invariant of `Σ*·a·Σ^ω` ("some `a`
  occurs") — build the latter as a fixture (three classes: `[ε]`;
  absorbing `T = fold(a)`; `B = fold(b)`; `P = {(T, T), (T, B)}`);
- **F-G (negative control, do NOT "fix" it)**: over `{a, b}`,
  `L = Σ*·b·Σ^ω` vs `Σ^ω`: their `d_p` is `0` (aligned xor-profile
  all-zero — the difference is `{a^ω}`) YET their reduced shadows are
  byte-DIFFERENT (`shadow(L) = L`, `shadow(Σ^ω) = Σ^ω`). Shadow
  equality is sufficient for `d_p = 0`, not necessary (paper §4.2
  warning); an implementation that makes F-G "pass" by equating the
  shadows is wrong.

## 10. M4 (QNT3) — entropy

Paper Prop 5.1: `A` = letter-count matrix on `Live × Live` (`Live`
from `calculus.surgery`), `h = log₂ ρ(A)`. Float quarantine: `ρ` via
power iteration with Collatz–Wielandt bracketing until the enclosure
is `< 1e-9` wide; report `(h_lo, h_hi)`; certificate = the `Live`
submatrix. Laws: `h(∅) = 0` convention; `h ≤ log₂|Σ|`; monotone under
inclusion on aligned pairs; `h(cl(L)) = h(L)` asserted on the
submatrices (exact structural equality), not on floats.

## 11. M5 (QNT4) — the Markov product

Paper Thm 3.5. Chain reader (`.mc` sidecar, CSV-shaped, no JSON — fix
the format with the corpus keeper first). Product chain on reachable
`states(M) × 𝒞`; bottom SCCs; per component `B`: base state `q̂` =
least occurring in `B`; cycle semigroup `T` = folds of labels of
`M`-cycles at `q̂`, computed by BFS over `(M-state, class)` pairs from
`(q̂, [ε])`, collecting the class at each return to `q̂`, iterated to a
fixpoint; kernel of `T` by the two-sided sink routine of §3.2
parameterized by generator set; `θ_B := Val(c, k)` for the least
`(q̂, c) ∈ B`; linear system over the product. Cross-checks: a
one-state `M` emitting all letters reproduces M1 exactly; `θ_B` from a
different base state agrees; Route A product-side on small chains.

## 12. M6 (QNT5) — the census campaign

Machine reports under `reference/quant/` (one `.md` + one `.csv` per
experiment, date / git-rev / seed / corpus header; `.cat`/CSV sidecar
columns, no JSON). E1 measure+θ-profile columns (distribution per
Wagner degree / safety band); E2 entropy column; E3 the *exact* metric
geometry per alphabet slice — NOT sampled: (a) all μ=0 languages are
one `d_p = 0` class and all μ=1 languages another (skip their pairs
entirely); (b) among the strictly-interior languages, dedup by reduced
shadow bytes (free), then decide the exact `d_p = 0` classes by the
aligned xor-profile on the survivors; (c) exhaustive all-pairs `d_p`
between class representatives (the M1 census counts make this a few
`10^5` alignments at worst) — report diameter, distance distribution,
clustering by Wagner degree, nearest-LTL-neighbor per non-LTL
language; E4 pipeline demo (one spec, a family of chains,
baseline = Route A route; wall-clock + spec-side artifact stability).
Per-case budget 15s; blown budget is a datum. Every number destined
for the paper lands first as a finding row in `sos_measure_report.md`
with its regeneration command.

## 13. Non-goals

- **MDPs / schedulers**: refused (branching wall, paper §4.3).
- **Semiring-valued `Val`**: future work, paper §7 last paragraph.
- **Hausdorff dimension**: not until entropy has landed.
- **Performance work of any kind**: census sizes are small; exactness
  and replayability outrank speed everywhere.
