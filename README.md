# BuchiToLTL

Experimental prototype for backward LTL reconstruction from Transition-based Generalized Büchi Automata (TGBA).

## Current Status

This is research / exploration code. The reconstruction is **incomplete by design**.

We now have two heuristics that can rescue certain formulas whose automata contain non-trivial SCCs:

* **f2** – size-2 non-accepting SCC absorption ("fusion test")
* **tN** – terminal SCC pattern (generalized from the original "t2" 2-state rule). Accepts any terminal SCC size ≥2 whose per-state L labels (derived from internal incoming edges) are pairwise mutually exclusive and strictly tighter than true. Technique strings now report `t3`, `t4`, ... for larger captured SCCs (e.g. `sl+t4`).

When either succeeds (and passes an internal language-equivalence soundness check on the isolated fragment), formulas that used to be reported `UNSUPPORTED` become fully reconstructible.

Key current capabilities:
- Explicit recursion with visiting set + depth limit (finite recursion)
- Early rejection of multi-state SCCs (unless a heuristic has already validated a fragment for them)
- Size-2 non-accepting SCC absorption (f2) when language-equivalent
- Terminal SCC steady-state extraction (tN) via incoming/outgoing label disjunction + round-trip validation (now size-agnostic)
- Downstream invariant detection: for any state, precomputes atoms forced to a constant value on all reachable future edges. Used for (a) simplifying outgoing edge labels via existential quantification, and (b) more precise attachment when crossing into terminal SCCs (invariant part always reached under X; choice/labeling part keeps the existing per-transition compatibility test).
- Trivial acceptance normalization (treat all transitions as accepting when `Acceptance: t`)
- "Technique" reporting: `sl`, `sl+f2`, `sl+t2`, `sl+t3`, `sl+t4`, `sl+f2+t3`, ...
- Dual output: constructive formula + version after Spot simplification (`ltlfilt` equivalent)
- Detailed tracing of the tN path under `RECONSTRUCT_TRACE=1`

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 buchi2ltl.py
```

Runs a small set of formulas (including both f2 and t2 cases) and shows:
- Original vs recovered LTL
- **Technique** used (`sl`, `sl+f2`, `sl+t2`, or `sl+f2+t2`)
- Equivalence result
- Constructive formula + simplified version

## Evaluation Harness

`evaluate.py` is the main tool for batch testing the reconstruction.

It supports **stable test sets** (important for regression work) in addition to random generation:

```bash
# Run only the curated samples from samples/formulas.py (stable set)
python3 evaluate.py --samples --no-random -o stable.csv

# Curated samples + 200 random formulas afterwards
python3 evaluate.py --samples -n 200 --seed 42 -o mixed.csv

# Load your own formulas (Python file with lists, or plain text one-per-line)
python3 evaluate.py -f my_hard_cases.py --no-random -o custom.csv

# Classic random-only mode (still fully supported)
python3 evaluate.py -n 500 --seed 7 --aps 3 -o results.csv
```

Key features:
- Explicit formulas are always processed **first** (stable ordering).
- Output CSV includes a `source` column (`samples/formulas.py`, `random(seed=42)`, or `file:yourfile.txt`).
- `UNSUPPORTED` cases are recorded cleanly as `equivalent=unsupported` instead of noisy errors.
- Use `--only-failures` to collect interesting cases.

See `python3 evaluate.py --help` for all options.

The `samples/` directory contains hand-curated formulas, including:
- `formulas.py` – the default set used by `evaluate.py --samples`
- `f2_successes.py` – 100 formulas for which the f2 heuristic activates
- `terminal_2scc_labeled.py` – 100 formulas for which the t2 heuristic activates

You can feed any of them directly to the evaluation harness:

    python3 evaluate.py -f samples/terminal_2scc_labeled.py --no-random -o t2_only.csv

Example HOAs for manual inspection live alongside them.

## Public API

```python
from buchi2ltl import reconstruct_ltl, try_size2_overapprox, try_terminal_2scc_with_validation, simplify_ltl

recovered, state_labels, technique = reconstruct_ltl(aut)

# Or call a heuristic in isolation (mainly for diagnostics / external tools)
nice = try_terminal_2scc_with_validation(aut)   # list of validated t2 fragments
```

## Notes

- Many formulas will still return `"UNSUPPORTED: ..."` (especially those with complex SCCs or entry-choice asymmetries into a terminal SCC).
- Two heuristics can now rescue size-2 SCCs:
  - `f2` – size-2 non-accepting SCC absorption (older, absorption-style)
  - `tN` – terminal SCC pattern (generalized; t2/t3/t4/...), G(OR (L(s) & X O(s)) style)
- Both heuristics only accept a candidate after a full Spot `are_equivalent` round-trip on the isolated fragment (soundness first).
- Detailed per-state traces for the t2 integration are emitted only when the environment variable `RECONSTRUCT_TRACE=1` is set (very verbose – intended for debugging the reconstruction rules themselves).
- All Spot simplification is currently bypassed (`simplify_ltl` is a no-op) so that the raw structure built by the labeler remains visible. Re-enable it in `buchi2ltl/utils.py` when you want the final "ltlfilt --simplify" look.
- Generated images (`*.png`, `*.dot`) and all `*.csv` / `*.log` files are gitignored.
- `testing/` contains the heavy experimental scaffolding:
  - `recovered_working_fusion_heuristic.py` – exact historical f2 code that produced the early debug images
  - `initial_state_rewiring.py` – the initial-state split experiment (kept because the user asked to preserve it even though it is no longer called from the production path)
  - `find_*.py` – the search scripts used to populate the stable 100-formula sample sets
- The historical recovered fusion file is in `testing/`, not `samples/`.

This repository is used for interactive development of the reconstruction technique. The tN pattern (generalized terminal-SCC labeling) is known to need further refinement (especially around prefix entry choice into the SCC and validation robustness for certain liveness-marked large SCCs).

## Experimental Algebraic Direction (kr/)

A parallel, more ambitious line of work explores the *algebraic* route to Büchi → LTL via Krohn-Rhodes holonomy cascade decomposition (SgpDec + GAP), following the construction of Boker, Lehtinen & Sickert (FoSSaCS 2022). See the self-contained `kr/` subdirectory (and `kr/README.md` + `kr/STATUS.md`) for the current status, `install.sh`, and the decomposition pipeline (Spot aut → generators → GAP/SgpDec → `Cascade`).

Recent work includes:
- File splits for smaller, focused modules ("one service per file") and stability (`bdd_utils.py`, `kr/gap/parse.py`, operator extraction).
- 1-level clean reconstruction: thin pure builder (`reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi` + `build_infinitely_often_accepting`) on top of the K operators, with the old ad-hoc version kept as `_heuristic` for comparison. No structural pattern matching in the main 1-level path.

This path is currently independent of the heuristic `buchi2ltl/` engine. It targets the theoretically complete case for counter-free deterministic automata (at the cost of a heavy external dependency and very large formulas in the worst case). The two approaches may eventually be combined (use heuristics for the common "nice" cases; fall back to the cascade construction when the language is LTL-definable but structurally complex).

See `kr/testing/` for verification harnesses that compare the clean vs heuristic paths and confirm stability.
