# roundtrip — exploration status & handoff

A working note for an in-progress research direction. Read this first, then the
**algorithm/doc pointers** below — *not* the implementation — to get a clean formal
background before touching any code.

## The idea in one paragraph

A translator labels a **presentation**, not an abstract language: two automata for the
same ω-language can decompose completely differently, and our structural translators
(daisy, the decomp family) are presentation-sensitive by design. So the portfolio has
a second axis we had never named — not just *which translator*, but *which
presentation to hand it*. **Round-trip** is the first move on that axis: take a faithful
formula, re-describe the language by it (`Language.of_ltl`), and label the fresh
presentation again. It is soundness-free to do (the language is invariant) and it is
the **bridge from the systematic engine to the structural ones**: the bls cascade is
blind (it unrolls, ignoring structure), so its output, re-presented, *exposes*
structure that daisy then captures in closed form.

## The witness that started it

`genaut/corpus/2state1ap1acc/aut_33300.hoa` — a 2-state Büchi automaton whose initial
state has a non-self incoming edge, so it is **not** a daisy. The default recipe
floors on the cascade and returns a faithful but sprawling 31-node formula
(`technique: buchi`). Round-tripped through spot, the *same language* re-emerges as a
**1-weak** automaton, the daisy peel reads it off, and the result is `a & GFa` — 5
nodes, `technique: buchi+daisy+roundtrip`. The language was 1-weak-recognizable all
along; the input merely *presented* it as a genuine 2-state SCC.

## Formal background — read these (algorithm/contract docs, not code)

- `aut2ltl/roundtrip/algorithm.md` — **the construction**: seed → re-describe →
  relabel; two applications of one child; faithful-or-declines; the soundness chain.
  This is the spine.
- `aut2ltl/daisy/algorithm.md` — the exemplar peel (exact on the 1-weak fragment).
  Explains *why* a reshape that lands 1-weak is then read off in closed form.
- `aut2ltl/README.md` — the architecture: `Language → LTLResult = Translator`, the
  faithful-or-declines contract that makes translators compose soundly.
- `aut2ltl/result.py` (module docstring only) — the **accumulator idiom** and the
  two combine monoids (composition `credit`/`fuse`, choice `first`/`best_of`).
- `aut2ltl/portfolio/README.md` — the recipe system and the **brick algebra**:
  `first_success` (choice), `recurse` (self-reference), `best_of` (choice-by-size),
  `compose` (decorator `∘`). Says how a recipe is added (two lines).
- `aut2ltl/recurse/recurse.py` (docstring only) — the **strict-descent contract**.
  Load-bearing for why "iterate the round trip" is *not* a `recurse` (a reshape is
  not a strictly-smaller sub-problem).
- Root `README.md` — scope: sound, complete on the LTL fragment, and it *decides*
  LTL-definability. Background on what the tool is.

The implementations are tiny and should be opened only when editing:
`aut2ltl/roundtrip/roundtrip.py`, `aut2ltl/portfolio/recipes/roundtrip.py`,
`aut2ltl/portfolio/builder.py` (the `daisy_*` / `core` / `bls` blocks).

## The unification (motivation, paper-worthy)

Three capabilities are the *same machinery* (`Language.of_ltl(φ)` + reconstruction):
- **round-trip reconstruction** (formula → automaton → smaller formula),
- **LTL → LTL simplification** (an LTL normalizer via reconstruction),
- **PSL/SERE → LTL** (LTL when definable; a NOT_LTL *decision* when not — already
  works, since the CLI/`of_ltl` parse PSL and the portfolio decides definability).

## Current state (what is committed)

- `Roundtrip` translator (`aut2ltl/roundtrip/`) — the pure decorator, follows the
  result accumulator idiom, with `algorithm.md`. **Done.**
- Recipe `roundtrip` = `Simplify(Roundtrip(cakedsdet), "hi")`, registered for
  `--use roundtrip`. Top-level placement (reshapes the *whole* formula). Verified on
  the witness by hand (31→5). **Wired, not benchmarked.**
- `Language.of_ltl` now records `(definable=True, conclusive=True)` for a
  *syntactically LTL* formula (gated on `f.is_ltl_formula()`, so PSL stays undecided).
  Cheapens every relabel (skips the GAP aperiodicity oracle on a provably-definable
  reshape) and keeps the PSL→LTL path honest. **Done.**

**Not done:** gates not run, survey not run, **benchmark not run**, no measurement of
hit/regress rates, no `roundtrip_fine`, no `Memo`. The default recipe is unchanged
(`cakedsdet`); `roundtrip` is experimental.

## Open issues

- **Never-regress gap.** `Roundtrip` returns the relabel *unconditionally*. If a
  reshape is *less* exploitable, the relabel can be **larger** than the seed, so the
  shipped `roundtrip` recipe can regress. The fix is a `best_of`-from-outside that
  keeps the better of plain-vs-round-tripped — which is *why* `Memo` matters (below).
- **No translator-call memo.** `Language` interns and caches its representations and
  its definability verdict, but `T(L) → LTLResult` is **recomputed every call**
  (verified: the only memos in the tree are in the LTL/simplify layer). So
  `best_of([C, Roundtrip(C)])` would run `C(L)` twice (incumbent + seed) — wasteful,
  since the cascade/GAP is the expensive part.
- **Iterating is a new combinator, not `recurse`.** A presentation-search loop
  (round-trip, re-decompose, repeat) descends in a *size* measure, not a structural
  one — it is `best_of`-shaped (size-monotone, fixpoint stop), and needs the
  empirical **reshape-idempotence** question answered first (does
  `reshape(reshape(F)) ≈ reshape(F)`?). For now the round trip is **one-shot**.

## Current directions

1. **`roundtrip_fine` — the deep/surgical recipe.** Inject the round trip at the
   cascade floor instead of the top, so only a *stubborn residual* (the part the peels
   could not handle) is reshaped, not the whole formula. Design settled and built only
   from existing bricks:
   ```
   M     = daisy_trio_det( core(options) )        # a recurse closure, floors on bls — terminates
   floor = first_success([ PartScc(), Roundtrip(M) ])
   incumbent_rt = Simplify( compose(Strength, Acc, daisy_trio_det)(floor), "hi" )
   ```
   `M` is a *separate* recurse closure (not the enclosing leaf — that would loop, by
   recurse's descent contract). One round trip, terminates by construction. Open:
   `M` light (`daisy_trio_det(core)`) vs full (`cakedsdet`); start light.
2. **`Memo` — a peer Translator decorator.** `Memo(child)` memoizes `child(L)` keyed
   by `Language` (interned, so identity is a good key). Per-instance cache (share by
   referencing one `Memo` instance), placement-flexible. Decide: **share-on-hit**
   (relies on the read-only discipline of `credit`/`fuse`/`best_of`) vs
   **clone-on-hit** (defensive; needs a small `LTLResult.copy`). General perf win
   beyond round-trip.
3. **The combo recipe.** `best_of([ Memo(C), Roundtrip(Memo(C)) ])` — never-regress
   *and* a shared seed. The orthogonality is the point: `Roundtrip` stays pure (no
   size judgment), `best_of` is the choice, `Memo` is the only thing that knows about
   sharing. Three bricks, three concerns.
4. **Measure / probe (not started).** Per-corpus **improve / regress / no-change**
   rates, **split by seed technique** (buchi/weak/cobuchi/muller — the "maybe only
   buchi reshapes well" hypothesis is one pivot table); improvement magnitude; cost;
   **placement A/B** (top vs `roundtrip_fine` vs per-decomp-part); and the
   reshape-idempotence check that gates whether the iterating loop is worth building.
5. **Gates + benchmark.** Run `tests/bls/test_kr_r4_audit.py` (must be CLEAN) and
   `tests/survey.py` (must end SUCCESS); then the benchmark. None run yet for any
   roundtrip recipe.
6. **Exhaustive `genaut/corpus` sweep.** Run every roundtrip recipe (and the
   `cakedsdet` baseline) over the *entire* generated corpus — the exhaustive census of
   small automata under `genaut/corpus/` was built precisely for coverage and for
   surfacing nice examples. This is the real validation: the true improve / regress /
   no-change distribution, the size-gain histogram, fresh witnesses, and — important —
   the **outliers** where the minimal LTL stays large (candidate genuinely-complex /
   non-counter-free languages). Pair every run with a per-formula baseline so a
   regression is visible per case, not hidden in the aggregate.

## Why it matters — usage scenarios

If aut2ltl reliably returns *small* formulas (and it should, except where the language
is genuinely, humanly-incomprehensibly complex — such cases are real, but likely
outliers), the tool stops being a curiosity and becomes a spec-engineering instrument.
Humans author **reactive, simple, counter-free** properties — they think "after
request, eventually grant," not in terms of syntactic-monoid aperiodicity — and for
that vast, practically-dominant fragment a compact LTL formula *exists*; aut2ltl finds
it. Concretely: **recover a readable spec** from an automaton produced by learning,
synthesis, a runtime monitor, or a legacy SERE/regex ("what does this machine actually
require?"); **simplify/normalize** bloated LTL that arose from products, negations, or
compositional construction (an LTL *linter*); translate **PSL/SERE → LTL** when
possible and *decide* when not, for portability and tool interop; and read the
**not-LTL-definable verdict as design feedback** — it usually means a property
accidentally demands counting, a smell, since humans rarely intend that. LTL is a
remarkably compact notation for surprisingly rich languages, which is exactly why the
reverse direction — automaton back to a *small* formula — is valuable rather than
hopeless: for the languages people actually build, the small formula is out there, and
the round-trip insight (re-present, re-derive) is one of the levers that reaches it.

## Speculative directions (capture before context cools)

- **Complement round-trip — aut2ltl in the middle.** A language and its complement are
  two presentations of the same information, and one is often far cleaner: a safety
  property is an awkward `G`/`R` tangle whose complement is a crisp reachability daisy.
  So complement the automaton, reconstruct *that*, and negate —
  `best_of( reconstruct(L), ¬reconstruct(¬L) )`. Complementation is exponential and
  Spot avoids it, but this construction is already (triple-)exponential, so the cost is
  in budget — and the complement is frequently the *simpler side to peel*. A
  deliberately contrarian presentation move: we usually dodge complements; here we
  court them. (Original to this session — worth real attention.)
- **Syntactic LTL decomposition — a new decomposition brick.** When a seed comes back
  as `ψ1 ∧ … ∧ ψk` (the cascade and the acceptance split both do this), the `∧` is
  language *intersection* at the LTL level: each `ψi` is a separate, weaker constraint
  and `L(∧ψi) = ⋂ L(ψi)`. So re-derive each conjunct *independently*
  (`ψi' = reconstruct(L(ψi))`) and relink with `∧` — every subproblem is a strictly
  *simpler* language (smaller automaton, likelier to peel) than the whole, and the
  seed's own syntax handed us the split *for free*, a split the product automaton
  hides. Same for `∨` (union, as strength / SCC do). This is `roundtrip` fused with
  `decomp`, but the parts come from the *formula's boolean tree*, not from re-analyzing
  the automaton: read the seed's top `∧`/`∨`, reshape-and-re-derive each operand,
  recombine, recurse into operands that are themselves conjunctions/disjunctions. Sound
  trivially (`ψi' ≡ ψi`); and it generalizes *below* the top layer — in LTL, ω-language
  equivalence is a **congruence** (equivalence at position 0 entails equivalence at
  every suffix, since `w,i ⊨ φ ⇔ w[i:] ∈ L(φ)`), so *any* subformula may be swapped for
  an ω-equivalent reconstruction, the `∧`/`∨` seams being merely the highest-value
  cuts. It turns the cascade's ugly-but-*structured* output into leverage: the `∧` it
  emits is not noise, it is a decomposition certificate.
- **Presentation portfolio.** `best_of` over the *formula-mediated* presentation moves
  — plain reconstruction, the round trip, the complement round-trip, the syntactic
  split — letting each language be reached by whichever move peels it. (Pure
  automaton-level re-presentation is *not* a member: Spot's rewriting is already wired
  into `Language`, and standalone automaton heuristics were explored earlier and
  abandoned as ineffective.)
- **Reshape the *simplified* seed.** Re-present `simplify(seed)` rather than `seed`:
  our DAG-aware simplifier differs from Spot's, and a simpler formula may translate to
  a simpler automaton. A cheap knob.

## The wider frame — an algebra of translators, on benign reality

**It is not a portfolio; it is an algebra.** What this codebase has built is an
**algebra over translators**: sound translators (language-faithful-or-decline) as the
carrier, and the combinators as operations — `compose` (`∘`), `recurse` (fixpoint),
`first_success` / `best_of` (choice), and now the *moves* `roundtrip`, `complement`,
`syntactic-decompose`, `simplify`. Soundness is the **homomorphism property** — every
operation preserves the language — so the algebra is **closed**: any term over the
bricks is itself a sound translator, by construction. "Portfolio" undersells this. The
operational reading is a best-first **search over a rewrite graph** of equivalent
presentations for the size-minimal node (`best_of` is its greedy depth-1 case); the
structural reading is the algebra, and that is the one to claim. The empirical fact
that one move took 31→5 says the graph has **low diameter** from cascade-blob to
minimal — `translate` is a violent normalizer funnelling many formulas onto few
automata. Whether that low diameter holds broadly is *the* measurable hypothesis under
the whole approach.

**The algebra is, precisely, Kleene-shaped — with tests.** Map the bricks onto the
signature: `compose` is sequencing (`·`, unit `identity` = `1`); the two choices are
sums (`+`, unit `decline` = `0`) — `first_success` a *priority* sum (first
non-declined, left-biased), `best_of` a *size-ordered* sum; and `recurse` is the
least-fixpoint star (`*`). The moves (`roundtrip`, `complement`, `syntactic-decompose`,
`simplify`) are generators, and the predicates that gate them — `is_daisy`,
`is_ltl_formula`, the definability verdict — are **tests**: guards in the
Kleene-Algebra-with-Tests sense. The payoff is not aesthetic: if the recipe algebra is
(close to) a KAT, **recipe equivalence is decidable** and recipe terms **normalize** —
we could prove two recipes compute the same thing, and simplify a recipe expression
before ever running it. The tool minimizes formulas by a rewrite algebra; the recipes
themselves form a rewrite algebra we can minimize — inner and outer are the same kind
of object. (Caveat: the two-sum, two-sorted shape is not vanilla KA; which axioms hold,
and on which sort, is the open formalization.)

**Its laws are exactly our probes.** The identities we would most want —
`roundtrip ∘ roundtrip ≈ roundtrip` (reshape reaching a fixpoint),
`complement ∘ complement = id`, `simplify ∘ simplify = simplify`, `best_of(a, a) = a`,
the absorptions of `first_success` — are precisely the experiments already on the plan.
The measurement campaign is therefore not only benchmarking; it is **checking the
algebra's equational theory**. "Probe reshape-idempotence" *is* "establish the law that
makes `roundtrip` a well-behaved star-able operator." Science and engineering are the
same activity here.

**This is a proven design, not a flourish.** The operators-as-semantics-preserving-
homomorphisms discipline is imported deliberately from the author's prior
decision-diagram library, where the same algebra — sound operators, closed under
composition — delivered engineering robustness as much as elegance. That lineage is
*how this project got here*; the translator algebra meets the same criterion in every
useful way, and the bet is that it pays off the same way again.

**Worst case is mostly a stale worry on real inputs.** The construction is
(triple-)exponential and LTL-definability is hard — and it mostly does not matter,
because decomposition + round-trip **localize the expense to the largest irreducible
core**, the residual no structural move can simplify. Practical cost is governed by
*kernel size*, not input size (the "the hard part is small" phenomenon — treewidth,
parameterized kernels). Human specs *have* small kernels: people author reactive,
counter-free, compositional properties; they do not intend counting, the way Zeno
undecidability in timed systems is a modelling artefact, not a real requirement. The
analogy is SAT — worst-case intractable, random instances brutal, yet it *just works*
on human formulas because those are structured and benign. aut2ltl sits in the same
place: realistically useful on the inputs that occur, worst case notwithstanding. The
corpus sweep can make this concrete via the **kernel-size distribution**, expected
sharply peaked at small.

**The scientific output is the definability atlas, not only the formulas.** Deciding
LTL-definability over the exhaustive `genaut` census yields a map nobody has: the
smallest non-definable automata, the structural patterns that tip a language out of
LTL, definable-vs-not density as state/acceptance counts grow. The moves preserve
language, so they do not move the boundary — they let us reach the verdict cheaply and
at scale. The size wins sell the tool; this atlas is the contribution to the empirics
of where the LTL / ω-regular frontier actually lies, and the natural companion to the
corpus generation already underway.

**On confluence / scheduling — resolve it experimentally, do not theorize it.** The
moves are not independent (simplify can erase the `∧` seams syntactic-decompose needs;
order matters), so the rewrite system is not obviously confluent. This is a real but
*experimental* question: the goal is to *have the bricks* — composable, toggleable —
and let measurement pick the schedule, not to seek an analytic confluence proof.

**Exhaustive generation is the engine of discovery.** This whole direction began with
a single automaton from the exhaustive small-automata census whose cascade output was
ugly and whose round trip was tiny — the census *surfaced the witness*. The byproduct
of the sweep — `(automaton, smallest formula, winning move sequence)` triples — is
also, for free, a training set for a future learned dispatcher that predicts the first
move to try from shallow automaton features, bootstrapping the portfolio's intuition
from its own exhaustive play.

## The deep frame — recovering what automata destroy

LTL has a property automata do not: **compositional nesting**. Its meaning is built
from subformula meanings *at every position*, because `w,i ⊨ φ ⇔ w[i:] ∈ L(φ)` — so
ω-equivalence is a **congruence**, and a subformula may be replaced by an ω-equivalent
*anywhere* in the tree, soundly. An automaton flattens exactly this: determinization
and product braid every constraint into one monolithic transition structure and the
compositional seams vanish. **Recovering those seams is, in a real sense, the whole
problem** — automaton→LTL is hard precisely because the automaton has destroyed the
nesting LTL carries natively. Several directions below are the same move seen twice:
recover structure the automaton hid.

### Syntactic decomposition — exploit the nesting a *seed* still carries

The seed formula has not been flattened — it still wears its boolean tree. When the
cascade returns `ψ1 ∧ … ∧ ψk`, that tree is a **decomposition certificate**: the engine
has told us `L = ⋂ L(ψi)`, no automaton analysis needed. Three sources of leverage:

- *The split is handed to us, not searched.* `decomp` normally has to discover a split
  by analyzing SCCs / acceptance conjuncts; here we read the AST.
- *Isolation un-mixes the product.* Each `L(ψi) ⊇ L(φ)` is weaker, and `of_ltl(ψi)`
  builds a fresh automaton for that one constraint, free of the entanglement that
  braids the conjuncts together in `φ`'s automaton. That entanglement is exactly what
  blinds automaton-level decomp; cutting the syntactic `∧` un-braids it. So this is the
  formula-side **dual** of `AccDecompose` / `SccDecompose`, and it splits where they are
  blind.
- *It generalizes past `∧`/`∨`.* By the congruence above, *any* ugly sub-DAG (a nested
  `X(!a R Fa)` blob buried under a `U`) can be reconstructed in isolation and
  substituted. The boolean operands are merely the highest-value, most-independent cuts.

The pipeline is all bricks we have or are building: `split` (read the tree) →
`reconstruct` each operand (the recursive leaf — *cheap now*, since `of_ltl` tags each
sub-language definable and skips GAP) → `relink` with the same connective → `simplify`
(which may re-factor structure shared across the rebuilt operands) → recurse into
operands that are themselves `∧`/`∨`. It composes with `roundtrip` (each operand
reconstruction *is* a round trip) and lands as a new `decomp/` brick —
`SyntacticDecompose`, whose splitter is the formula, not the automaton. Open policy:
target by sub-DAG size (biggest blobs first) or top-layer-plus-one, and let `best_of`
keep the win; the cascade's top-level `∧` is the prime target, where ugliness and
structure coincide. Soundness caveat: future-time LTL only (our output) — not PSL with
past or SERE semantics.

## The kernel and its three certificates

Across the threads one object keeps returning: the **irreducible kernel** — the residual
that survives all structural peeling and falls to the cascade. It is at once the
complexity bottleneck (the only place the exponential is paid), the carrier of
non-definability (counting structure is exactly what cannot be peeled into compositional
LTL), and the locus of every diagnostic below. Three moves shrink, name, and quantify it.

**Shrink it — bidirectional peeling.** Daisy peels the *front* (clean local test: no
non-self incoming). The dual back-peel is harder *for a reason*: acceptance is a property
of infinite suffixes, so terminal structure is not disposable scaffolding — a terminal
SCC *is* the acceptance and must be labelled, not cut (that is `partscc`'s job). The
practical lever is to **widen the terminal catalog**: a **tail oracle** that, per state,
cheaply recognizes an LTL-trivial tail (`∅`, `Σω`, safety `G(B)`, guarantee `F(B)`,
persistence `FG`, recurrence `GF`, a one-step obligation) and marks it a leaf with a
known label, so the cascade never recurses past it; plus a **tail-language quotient**
(merge states with identical tail languages on the cascade's own generic-acceptance
form, where Spot's parity-minimization may not reach). Front peel + tail recognition =
the cascade sees only the irreducible *middle*. (Open: how to prune suffixes is not yet
solved — this is the current best handle.)

**Name it — the counting witness (a checkable SERE certificate).** Non-definability is
*not* witnessed by a single ω-word; the certificate is a **counting family**: a pumping
triple `(u, v, w)` and period `p > 1` such that `u·vⁿ·wω` flips membership in `L` as
`n mod p` — `L` distinguishes `vⁿ` by `n`, which counter-free LTL cannot. It is
extractable from the failing aperiodicity test (GAP's non-trivial subgroup gives the
period word `v`; the reaching states give `u`; the accepting tail gives `w`), and a SERE
expresses it compactly. Two payoffs: the NOT_LTL verdict becomes an **independently
checkable proof** (verify the alternation — `conclusive` becomes a witness, not a flag);
and at census scale the witnesses form a **field guide to non-LTL-ness** — the minimal
counting atoms, the periods that occur, how obstructions compose — the LTL/ω-regular
frontier drawn *with witnesses*, not only counts.

**Quantify it — the two-sided LTL bracket.** Decomposition yields sound one-sided LTL
bounds; take both at once — an under-approximation `B ⊆ L` (the LTL disjuncts of a
`∨`-split) and an over-approximation `A ⊇ L` (the LTL conjuncts of a `∧`-split) — so
`B ⊆ L ⊆ A`. Then `L` is LTL-definable **iff the bracket collapses** (`A = B`), and the
**bracket width is a quantitative distance-from-LTL**: not yes/no but *how much* escapes
LTL, and where (the gap `A ∖ B` is concentrated at the kernel, and the counting witness
lives inside it). The point-certificate (witness) and the set-certificate (bracket) are
the same frontier at two resolutions. Uses are immediate: `A` is a sound LTL **rejection
monitor** even when `L` is not LTL-monitorable; `B` is a sound **synthesis target**; and
the pair drives a structure-guided **abstraction-refinement** loop (peel more kernel,
tighten until they meet or stabilize on the non-LTL essence).

The keystone: the tool's deepest output is not the formula or the verdict but **the
kernel and its three certificates** — the LTL part (bracket), exactly why the rest is not
LTL (witness), and the smallest carrier of both the hardness and the non-definability
(the peeled kernel). A candidate spine for a second paper, distinct from the
size-reconstruction one.

## Concrete next steps

1. **Validate the floor patch.** Run `tests/bls/test_kr_r4_audit.py` (must be CLEAN)
   and `tests/survey.py` (must end SUCCESS) against the committed `of_ltl` change
   before relying on it — it is the only shared-floor edit so far.
2. **Build `Memo`** as a peer Translator decorator (per-instance, keyed by Language;
   decide share- vs clone-on-hit). The smallest, most reusable brick; it unblocks the
   combo.
3. **Build the never-regress combo recipe** `best_of([ Memo(C), Roundtrip(Memo(C)) ])`
   and `roundtrip_fine` (floor injection, light `M`). Both are two-line wirings.
4. **Exhaustive `genaut/corpus` sweep** of `cakedsdet` vs `roundtrip` vs
   `roundtrip_fine`, per-formula with baselines, then pivot improve / regress /
   no-change **by seed technique**. This answers "does it generalize, and to which
   families."
5. **Probe reshape-idempotence** on a sample (`reshape(reshape(F))` vs `reshape(F)`).
   Its answer decides whether the iterating presentation-search combinator
   (size-monotone, fixpoint stop — *not* `recurse`) is worth building.
6. Only then, if the data warrants, consider re-pointing the default.

## Disposition

Experimental. Default unchanged. The `of_ltl` definability patch is the only change
that touches a shared floor; it is committed but the gates have **not** been run on it
yet (do that before relying on it).
