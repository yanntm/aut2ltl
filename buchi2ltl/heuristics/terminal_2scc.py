"""
Heuristic for "nice" terminal accepting SCCs (the "t2" pattern, generalized).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOTIVATION AND APPROACH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many LTL formulas that are "eventually linear" (after some prefix behavior they
settle into a simple oscillation) produce TGBA with a terminal SCC of any
size >=2 under the "GeneralizedBuchi Small High" translation from Spot.
The original implementation required exactly two states; this has been relaxed
to any size as long as the per-state L labels (derived from internal incoming
edges) are pairwise mutually exclusive and all strictly tighter than true.

Classic examples:
    G(p -> X q)          --> terminal SCC {0,1} with p-dependent choice of entry
    G((!p & X p) | (p & X !p))   (alternating)
    many GF(p & X q) variants after some prefix

For such SCCs the two states can be given *state labels* L derived purely from
the automaton structure:
    L(s) = OR of all (formulas on edges entering s)

If all L(s) for s in the SCC are:
    - strictly tighter than "true"  (i.e. they actually constrain the alphabet)
    - pairwise mutually exclusive (L(s) & L(t) == false for s != t)

then the whole SCC can be described by the single LTL formula

    G(  OR_{s in SCC} (L(s) & X O(s))  )

where O(s) is the OR of the conditions on edges *leaving* s.

This is a sound characterization of "being in the SCC forever".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOUNDNESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We never trust the pattern on faith.  try_terminal_2scc_with_validation()
isolates the SCC states + their *internal* transitions into a fresh automaton,
translates the candidate G(...) back to an automaton with the same settings,
and only accepts the fragment if spot.are_equivalent() holds.

Only after this round-trip check do we pre-populate state_formula[] in the
main reconstruction and protect the SCC states from the "bad_states" multi-SCC
rejection pass.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY DESIGN DECISIONS (history)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* We compute L using *only internal edges of the SCC* (see
  _compute_internal_incoming_or).  Using the whole automaton polluted L with
  literals from transient prefix states (e.g. an "r" that only appears on an
  edge leading into the SCC).  The user explicitly asked for the internal-only
  variant first.

* We dropped the "initial state rewiring / precursor split" for the production
  path (user: "Drop the whole precursor thing, we just accept it if initial
  state is one of the SCC").  The split code is preserved in
  testing/initial_state_rewiring.py for future experiments or debugging.

* No Spot simplification is performed on the produced fragment during
  reconstruction (see utils.py and the commented-out .simplify() here).  This
  keeps the raw G&X structure visible for debugging; W operators etc. hide the
  reconstruction decisions.

* We look for the pattern *before* the blanket |SCC|>1 rejection in
  reconstruction.py, exactly analogous to how size-2 fusion (f2) is tried.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT LIMITATIONS / OPEN QUESTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pattern gives a *steady-state* description of the SCC.  When a prefix leads
into it, the entry edge may choose which of the SCC states we land in first.
Some formulas (e.g. "r U G(!p | Xq)") have p-dependent choice of entry state.
The current symmetric G(...) can over-approximate the entry and produce a
slightly different automaton for the full formula.  The reconstruction layer
now resolves the exact entry-timing subtlety (see the two HOA examples with
"r & XG(!p | Xq)" vs "r U G(!p | Xq)"): when attaching a prefix to the SCC
fragment it checks (via BDD implication) whether each crossing label L implies
the I(s_in) of its target SCC state.  If yes the invariant is attached
synchronously as "(L) & f"; otherwise the delayed "(L) & X(f)" is used.
This yields the precise "r U f" vs "r & X f" shapes for the two cases.

The technique is therefore marked "t2" in the reported technique string and is
still considered experimental / in need of refining, but it already turns many
previously-UNSUPPORTED cases into fully supported, equivalence-checked ones.

    WHY ONLY INTERNAL EDGES?
    ------------------------
    When a transient prefix state has an edge into the SCC carrying a literal
    that never appears on any *internal* transition of the SCC (classic example:
    "r & X G(p -> X q)"), the whole-automaton version of L would contain that
    literal (e.g. L(0) = "r & !p").  That literal does not belong to the
    "steady-state" alphabet of the SCC; it is part of the *entry condition*
    from outside.

    Using only internal edges gives the pure steady-state labels that the
    G(L & X O || ...) pattern expects.  The prefix handling is left to the
    normal reconstruction rules on the states *before* the SCC (they will emit
    the appropriate "r & X(...)" wrapper using the fragment we pre-populate
    for the SCC states).

    The user explicitly chose this variant after seeing polluted labels on
    the "r & X ..." family.

    Scan the automaton for terminal SCCs (of any size >=2) for which we can
    compute "nice" per-state labels L(s).

    A nice terminal SCC satisfies:
        1. Size >= 2.
        2. It is terminal: every outgoing transition from any state stays
           inside the SCC (no escape edges).
        3. Every L label (OR of *internal* incoming edges to that state) is
           strictly tighter than "true".
        4. All L labels are pairwise mutually exclusive: for every distinct
           pair s,t we have L(s) & L(t) == false.

    When all four hold we synthesize the candidate steady-state formula

        G( (L(s1) & X O(s1)) | (L(s2) & X O(s2)) | ... )

    This generalizes the original "t2" (terminal-2-state) rule. The user
    observed that the pairwise-disjointness of the L labels is what matters
    for a precise disjunctive characterization; the hard size==2 limit was
    unnecessary.

    The function deliberately does *not* call any initial-state rewiring.
    If the original initial state happens to be one of the SCC states we
    still accept the SCC (the main reconstruction will just use the fragment
    for that state directly).
