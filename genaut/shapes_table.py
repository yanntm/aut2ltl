"""genaut/shapes_table.py — regenerate SHAPES.md from the corpus census.md files.

Composes the full dedup **funnel** of every censused shape, one row per shape,
from the two census.md sources generation writes:

  corpus/tgba/<tag>/census.md   combos -> byte-distinct (md5) -> AP-canonical
                                `kept` (gen/enumerate.py);
  corpus/det/<tag>/census.md    AP-canonical kept -> **language-distinct** (the
                                syntactic `𝓘` dedup of gen/canonize.py).

No arithmetic here beyond the collapse ratio — just read what each stage
recorded — and write the SHAPES.md feasible-shapes table sorted by N. A shape
whose `det/` tier is not built yet shows `—` in the language column.

PROSE_HEAD = """# genaut shapes — the bestiary map

The shapes the census enumerates, and the tractability wall. A **shape** is
`Shape(n, k, c)` — `n` states, `k` atomic propositions, `c` acceptance sets (see
[`gen/algorithm.md`](gen/algorithm.md)). Each shape's generator-id space is

```
slots = n^2 * 2^c                      (one edge slot per (src, dst, markset))
N     = (2^(2^k)) ^ slots              (guards = all Boolean functions over k APs)
```

`N` is **doubly exponential in `k`**, exponential in `n^2` and `2^c`, so exhaustive
enumeration only reaches small shapes. Each row below is a one-off census written to
`corpus/<tag>/` with a `census.md`; **this table is generated from those census.md
files** (`python3 genaut/shapes_table.py`), not hand-kept.

## Feasible shapes (the dedup funnel, from corpus/*/census.md)

The columns trace one shape's collapse across the pipeline's dedup levels:
`combos` (generator-id space `N`) -> `byte-distinct` (md5 after Spot reduction) ->
`kept` (AP-canonical, the `tgba/` tier: distinct up to `a<->!a` polarity and AP
rename) -> **`langs`** (the `det/` and `sos/` tiers: distinct languages by the
syntactic `𝓘` dedup). `collapse` is `kept / langs` — how many relabel-distinct
TGBA share one language. `survey`: the high-`kept` shapes (**deferred**) are heavy
and run separately. A `—` in `langs` means the canonical tier is not built yet
(`python3 genaut/gen/rebuild.py`).
"""

PROSE_TAIL = """
## Beyond the wall (first intractable)

| shape | N | why |
|---|---|---|
| `2state2ap1acc` | 16^8 ~ 4.3e9 | the true k=2 analog of 2state1ap1acc |
| `1state2ap3acc` | 16^8 ~ 4.3e9 | |
| `1state3ap2acc` | 256^4 ~ 4.3e9 | |
| `3state2ap0acc` | 16^9 ~ 6.9e10 | |
| `3state1ap1acc` | 4^18 ~ 6.9e10 | 3-state with both an AP and acceptance |

## Reading the numbers

- **`k >= 1` only.** 0-AP shapes are excluded: a one-letter alphabet has a single
  ω-word, so the only languages are `0` and `1` — no linguistic content to census.
- **`k` drives the polarity fold**: the relabel group is `2^k * k!`, so the fold grows
  fast with APs.
- **The LTL frontier is `n >= 2` AND `k >= 1`**: counting needs a multi-state cycle
  over a real alphabet (a non-aperiodic monoid). 1-state shapes stay all-LTL; not-LTL
  first appears at `2state1ap0acc`.
- **Generation is cheap; surveying is not** — running `aut2ltl` over a shape's `kept`
  automata scales with `kept`, so the high-`kept` shapes are surveyed separately.
