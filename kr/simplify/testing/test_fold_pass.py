Validation for Rule 4 (unroll-inverse folding) — fold_simplify alone for
the core cases, the combined `simplify` pipeline for the end-to-end ones.
Harness contract as the other suites: PASS requires Spot-verified language
equivalence; expected shapes when given; must-not-change cases guard
against over-firing (a & XFa is NOT Fa; mismatched guards stay put).
