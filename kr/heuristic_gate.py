kr/heuristic_gate.py — the buchi2ltl heuristic as a pre-filter for the
decompose-and-recombine dispatcher.

Historically buchi2ltl/ (backward labeling + the f2 size-2 / t2 terminal-SCC
absorption heuristics) and kr/ (the paper cascade) were kept strictly separate.
The paper construction is now stable, so we WIRE the heuristic in as a gate:
at each node of `decompose_recombine._dispatch` (and on the raw input first) we
try the heuristic; if it returns a formula we adopt it (it is tiny and fast),
otherwise we fall through to the kr cascade. Combining the heuristic WITH
decomposition is the new idea — cases the heuristic cannot take whole may split
into pieces it can.

Soundness — a composition of sound steps, NO per-call equivalence check:

    arbitrary HOA  --(Spot postprocess, language-preserving)-->  TGBA
                   --(buchi2ltl, self-validating)-->            formula

buchi2ltl's input form is a TGBA; our node may carry any acceptance, so we ask
Spot to make it a TGBA (language-preserving).

WHAT buchi2ltl ACTUALLY IS (so this is not misread again — sl is the core, NOT
a guess-and-check heuristic):

  * `sl` (self-loop / semi-linear backward labeling, `buchi2ltl/reconstruction.py`
    `label`) is the CORE and is an EXACT state-elimination translation. For each
    state it partitions outgoing edges into self-loops and exits, recurses
    (memoized) on the exit targets, and assembles the language from that state by
    fixed rules:
        - self-loops only, accepting:        G(⋁self) & GF(⋁acc)
          (one GF per acceptance set for generalized Büchi)
        - self-loops + exits, accepting:     [G(⋁self) & GF(⋁acc)] | (⋁self U ⋁exit)
          (the stay-forever-vs-leave dichotomy)
        - non-accepting self-loops + exits:  (⋁self) U (⋁exit)
        - exits only:                        ⋁ (cond & X succ)
    with per-edge downstream invariants conjoined.
    This is EXACT precisely on the VERY-WEAK (1-weak) fragment — automata whose
    only cycles are self-loops (every nontrivial SCC is a single self-looping
    state); there the U / G / GF encoding is the standard provably-correct
    translation. OFF that fragment sl DECLINES: a state re-entered while on the
    recursion stack (`visiting`), or a successor inside a genuine multi-state SCC
    with no validated fragment (`bad_states`), yields the `UNSUPPORTED` sentinel,
    which poisons upward (any compound term containing it collapses the whole
    state). sl never emits a formula for a structure it cannot translate exactly
    — it fails loudly. So its soundness is BY CONSTRUCTION (exact-on-fragment +
    decline-otherwise), not post-hoc checking.

  * `f2` (`size2_overapprox`) and `t2` (`terminal_2scc`) are a SEPARATE,
    guess-and-check layer: they PROPOSE an LTL fragment for a 2-state / terminal
    SCC and VALIDATE it by language equivalence before sl is allowed to use it
    (injected as a pre-validated `scc_fragments[q]`). Sound because verified — a
    wrong guess is simply not adopted.

Net: the gate's adopted output is sound because sl is exact on its fragment and
f2/t2 are verify-before-use. The opt-in audit (`KR_GATE_VERIFY`, default OFF;
re-checks every adopted candidate against its node automaton and counts
`rejected`) is CONFIRMATION, not the foundation — it found ZERO rejections over
~170 randltl formulas (`fuzz_gate_decompose.py`). Combining the heuristic WITH
decomposition is the lever: decomposition exposes pieces that fall into the
very-weak sl fragment (or f2/t2), and the kr cascade carries the rest.

This module is the ONE place kr touches buchi2ltl; the core operators stay pure.
