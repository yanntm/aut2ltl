# kr/ Current Status

**Note**: This document previously had a "before further coding" framing. The bulk of the original pre-refactor text has been retained below (lightly edited) as historical context. The "Progress after resume" section and refreshed "What is implemented" / "Gaps" sections reflect the post-refactor state (as of the 1-level clean reconstruction work and file splits for focus/stability).

**Goal of kr/**: Full general algebraic Büchi-to-LTL via Krohn-Rhodes holonomy cascade (Boker-Lehtinen-Sickert 2022), *without any pattern matching* on specific SCC structures (unlike the old buchi2ltl/ heuristics with f2/tN).

This is separate from the heuristic path. We want the systematic construction: decomp -> config paths -> inductive reachability K operators -> Fin/Inf -> acceptance encoding -> top LTL.

## What is implemented (current post-refactor state)

### Decomposition + Data (Paper Step 1 + part of 2)
- Full end-to-end: `decompose_aut(det_spot_aut)` (requires deterministic aut; use "Deterministic" in translate). Uses extract + generated GAP script (LoadPackage("SgpDec") + HolonomyCascadeSemigroup + AsCoords, adapted for SgpDec 1.x) + parse.
- `Cascade` dataclass is rich and general (see `cascade.py`):
  - num_levels, levels (size + kind/structure from SgpDec)
  - state_to_config / config_to_state (1-based coords)
  - generator_images (augmented with dead rejecting trap for incomplete auts — preserves language)
  - aps, letter_valuations (prop→bool dicts for every 2^|AP| letter — exactly for LTL guards)
  - original_aut ref
  - Methods (general, algebraic, no patterns): `move_config`, `all_configs`, `build_config_transitions`, `build_configuration_automaton`, `accepting_configs` (heuristic lift).
- Extraction completes incomplete auts with a dedicated dead rejecting trap (dead = n). Generators are total.
- Works on trivials, simples, and the motivating example (usable config auts even with dead trap).
- GAP bridge (`gap_bridge.py`), `install.sh`, `check_gap_available` are general. Synthetic path (`decompose_gens`) for testing without Spot.
- **File organization for focus/stability**: Parser moved to `kr/gap/parse.py` (small focused service); stability helpers in `bdd_utils.py` (precomputed buddy vars to avoid segfaults during extraction).

This part is solid and general (algebraic, no heuristic patterns on the automaton shape).

### Reachability Operators + Clean 1-level Reconstruction (Paper Step 3, base + clean top)
- Operators in `reachability_operators.py` (smaller focused file):
  - Helpers: `letters_to_prop`, `make_guard`.
  - 1-level base cases for reset levels: `one_level_reach_stay`, `one_level_reach_strong` (avoids B), `one_level_reach_weak`, `build_1level_reachability`.
  - General: take trans dict (from any config) + valuations + aps + τ tail. Build guarded U expressions from stay/change letters. No hard-coded patterns.
- High-level reconstruction (in `reachability.py`, now slim policy layer after splitting operators out):
  - `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi(casc)` — the **thin pure builder** (main path for 1-level). For num_levels != 1 it raises NotImplemented (use `_heuristic` for comparison/fallback on multi-level). Core logic: `build_infinitely_often_accepting()` which expresses "from the initial config, always eventually reach some accepting config" using `one_level_reach_strong(..., tau="true")`. Chooses `F(reach)` for absorbing acc sinks vs. `G(F(reach))` otherwise — decision made purely from the trans dict (no original_aut shape inspection, no dead/permanent/1-state/"q" filter special cases).
  - `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi_heuristic(casc)` — the old ad-hoc version (kept unchanged for A/B comparison during development; contains the structural ifs we wanted to move away from).
- Both versions + operators are exported in `kr/__init__.py`.
- 1-level cases (Fa, false, etc.) now go through the clean K-operator path and produce simple formulas equivalent to the original (verified via Spot `are_equivalent` in the `kr/testing/` harnesses).
- Fin_1level / inf_1level remain placeholders (will be expressed via K in future).

The 1-level path is now general/algebraic ("from init, G F (reach some acc via the operators)"), not ad-hoc. This was the main deliverable of the post-crash refactor work.

### Induction / Multi-level, Fin/Inf, Acceptance, Top Formula (Paper Steps 3–5)
- Still the main missing pieces.
- No recursive multi-level K operators (paper's 4 cases for top-level unchanged with sub-reach on Stay/Leave + change/Enter cases).
- No proper Fin/Inf using reachability, no full acceptance encoding (Büchi as disjunction of Inf over lifted accepting configs), no general top-level formula construction.
- The clean 1-level foundation (operators + thin builder + absorbing logic) is intended to be the base for induction.

### Testing / Examples / Other
- Full verification harnesses live in `kr/testing/` (see `kr/testing/README.md`):
  - `test_kr_reconstruct.py` — compares clean vs heuristic on curated cases (constants, 1-level, multi-level); uses subprocess isolation per case for stability; reports equiv where possible.
  - `diag_stability.py` — repeated isolated decomp on historically crashy cases (Xa, etc.).
- Demos: `examples/spot_det.py`, `examples/synthetic.py` (extract + config aut + 1-level reach starters).
- Generated .gap scripts in `examples/generated/`.
- No dependence on old f2/tN patterns.
- Still limited to small |AP| (explicit 2^|AP| letters).
- Cascade data from SgpDec is faithfully represented.
- Stability: bdd_utils precompute + isolation eliminated sporadic segfaults during extraction (verified repeatedly).

## Historical note (pre-1-level clean refactor)
(The following text is retained from the original "before further coding" version for context.)

### Top-level Reconstruction (old ad-hoc state)
- The original `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi(casc)` contained significant ad-hoc structural logic (early returns using original_aut, special handling for 1-state/dead/permanent sinks, has_bad_self checks, special "q" filters for until cases, fallbacks to guarded U + GF).
- It produced correct equivalent formulas for many trivials/simples via special paths, but for the motivating G(p→(q U r)) (then 1-level) it was not equivalent.
- This was exactly the "pattern matching on structure" we wanted to avoid. It served as a prototype while building the operators.

(The rest of the historical gaps around induction etc. have been incorporated into the current "Gaps" section below.)

## Gaps for the full general approach (updated)
- **Multi-level induction** (core remaining piece): No recursive implementation of the paper's compound formulas for >1 levels (the 4 cases for "top level unchanged" with sub-reach on lower levels for Stay/Leave + the change/Enter case with subcalls). We have a solid 1-level base (operators + thin builder); induction is the next step.
- Fin/Inf not yet implemented using the reachability operators (still placeholders).
- Acceptance encoding + full top-level formula not general (Büchi as disjunction of Inf over lifted accepting configs; support for general Muller etc.).
- Acc lift is still heuristic on configs (paper ideally wants precise on transitions/moves for the K definitions). The clean 1-level path already avoids most structural inspection by using the trans dict + valuations.
- Refined top-level obligations for mixed safety/liveness (more cases may benefit from F(reach) vs G F(reach) decisions or plain G(stay guards) for pure safety).
- Guard simplification (long DNFs from make_guard for high |AP| or full-letter cases) — current formulas are correct but can be ugly; Spot simplification is intentionally off for debugging.
- Still limited to small |AP| (explicit 2^|AP|).

The decomp/config part and the clean 1-level reconstruction are in good general shape. The LTL construction is now at "1-level operators + thin pure K-based top for 1-level" (no more ad-hoc in the main 1-level path).

## On the roadmap steps (updated)
- Step 1 (decomp semi-aut to cascade): Covered, general (with stability improvements via bdd_utils and focused parser in kr/gap/).
- Represent runs as config paths (step 2): Covered (config aut + build_* methods).
- Define reachability inductively (step 3): Base 1-level K operators exist and are general (in the smaller `reachability_operators.py`). The thin clean `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi` + `build_infinitely_often_accepting` is the pure builder on top of them. **Ready for the induction** — implement the recursive multi-level versions of the operators per the paper (using sub-reach on lower levels for Stay/Leave/Enter cases). This remains the core missing piece for "full general".
- Fin/Inf (step 4), acceptance (step 5): Not yet.

We now have the clean 1-level foundation (operators + thin builder using K only) that the induction can build on. The operators give us the reusable base to recurse.

See `kr/testing/` for the harnesses that compare clean vs heuristic and validate stability/equivalence on curated cases.

### Historical progress note (post-crash refactor)
- Old ad-hoc body isolated as `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi_heuristic`.
- New thin `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi` + `build_infinitely_often_accepting` (uses `one_level_reach_strong` on init→acc with tau=true; F vs G F chosen from trans dict for absorbing accs).
- Split for smaller focused files: `reachability_operators.py`, `bdd_utils.py` (stability), `gap/parse.py`.
- Stability: precomputed buddy var map once before the per-letter loop; Xa and other cases now reliable in repeated isolated runs.
- Pure 1-level cases (Fa, false, ...): clean path taken; "false" and Fa give correct equivalent LTL via the pure K path (no structural ifs).
- Both versions + operators exported; heuristic available for comparison.
- (Further tuning of top-level obligations, guard simplification, and multi-level induction remain.)
