kr/testing/test_kr_r4_audit.py

Placed audit script (per rules) for P0 R4/Rws correctness items from kr/TODO.md
and the "Audit & Validation Notes" in kr/automata_to_LTL_reference.md.

Focus: semantic grounding (Path A), duality hints (Path B), exact 5-point
checklist (Path C) against current _*_weak / Rws usage, plus better canary
(Path D) like G(p | F q) style.

Does NOT modify core formula code. Only inspects + exercises current impl
behaviorally + via source for the checklist. Uses Spot for semantics checks
on crafted words/configs for 1L reset cascades.

Run (always):
  timeout 5 python3 kr/testing/test_kr_r4_audit.py

All inside work folder, no /tmp, no inline long python.
