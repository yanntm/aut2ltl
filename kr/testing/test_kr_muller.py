kr/testing/test_kr_muller.py

Diagnostic for Muller acceptance handling vs current parity/SCC proxy.

Run from kr/ subdir or project:
  cd kr/testing
  python3 test_kr_muller.py

Explores:
- What Spot gives for get_acceptance() after different postprocess (parity, muller, etc.).
- Behavior of scc_info.is_rejecting_scc for different acc (including pure Muller).
- What our accepting_configs and _compute_good_muller_sets return.
- Whether we can support alpha that is general Muller (not just "SCC with acc" ).

This helps answer "what is stopping us from computing Muller ? for alpha not SCC"

All in kr/testing/ path, no /tmp, no long -c.
