## HANDOFF 2 — true-cascade extraction (2026-06-11, later session)

**Root cause of `Ga | Gb` equiv=FALSE found and fixed — extraction, not
operators.** Two stacked bridge bugs: (1) `AsCoords(s, hcs)` is
`DomainOf(hcs)[s]` (an enumeration accident), the real lift is
`AsHolonomyCoords(s, sk)`; (2) conjugating D's transitions through the lift
is unsound — holonomy coordinatization is a many-to-one COVER π, the true
successor is `OnCoordinates(c, AsHolonomyCascade(g, sk))`. Earlier passing
cases were degenerate (per-letter actions context-free consistent).
Fix: gap_bridge emits lifts + TRANS closure + PI (π); parse reverses coords
(SgpDec top-first ↔ operators peel deepest-first); Cascade.move_config /
all_configs use the explicit table. Diagnosis chain preserved in
`probe_reset_consistency.py` (identity-or-reset check per level/context) and
`probe_sgpdec_api.g` (API ground truth). trace_fin grounding made
cover-aware (GTs on the config semiautomaton) with per-check Spot caps.
Result: Ga|Gb and G(a->Xb) zero grounding contradictions; Fa/GFa/aUb/Fa|Gb
equiv True; audit CLEAN.

**Memo round (done, same day):** ladder re-ran — 21 equiv=True (incl. 3L
`Xa`/`a&Xa`/`a|Xb`/`G(a->Xa)`), zero FALSE; new frontier was construction
blowup on `(a U b)|Gc` / `FGa|FGb` / `GFa&GFb`. Fixed by (i) memoizing the
five helpers (only reach was cached; 91.5% hit rate was tripping the
raw-call guard → now counts distinct subproblems, `KR_REACH_GUARD`), and
(ii) dropping tl_simplifier from the construction path (`_simp_f` identity
by default; `KR_SIMP_TREE_LIMIT` 0/N/-1) — POLICY: we never wait on a
stalled external call; Spot is hash-consing only in the hot path. All three
now build (9.5s/1.6s/0.7s). Bonus fixes: narrowed the exception swallow in
`_dashed_change_strong`, seeded GAP RNG (reproducible decompositions).

**Exact next steps:**
1. `(a U b)|Gc` end-to-end: construction builds in 9.5s but reconstruct's
   FINAL FLAT-STRING serialization blows the 30s budget — the str() API
   contract is now the bottleneck. Options: return/carry formula objects to
   callers (str only on demand), DAG-aware output format, or down-stream
   compositional consumption. Folds into P0-verify below.
2. P0-verify remains THE wall for everything ≥2L-nontrivial: Spot translation
   of formulas with 100+ distinct temporal subformulas (32-acc-set fast
   error) or megabyte flat unfoldings (timeouts). Spot authors contacted
   about sharing-aware translation (our outputs: ~1000-node DAGs, >1200x
   unfolding — the ideal client). Meanwhile: vacuous-conjunct pruning,
   OUR OWN cheap normalization (constructor-level; replaces what
   tl_simplifier used to fold), equivalence-based interning, compositional
   checking (trace_fin is the per-sub-term oracle), word sampling
   (pitfall #10).
3. With the cover in place, revisit P1 "Muller lift exactness": π-preimage
   handling in `accepting_configs`/fallback paths of config_graph.py still
   maps states through the lift only (primary pruned-config-aut path is
   already correct via `state_of` = π).
4. Re-run the full survey ladder post-memo (expect: same 21 True; exploders
   move from ERROR to construct-ok/serialization-bound).

## HANDOFF — where debugging stands (written at end of 2026-06-11 session)

**What just happened:** All five operators were rewritten to the LITERAL paper
forms (see STATUS "Operators"). The former approximations (from-S letter
enumeration, first-step recursion, bespoke weak forms, wrong weak base) were
the 2L breakers — each was found by semantic grounding with witness words, and
each fix was verified against `paper/Automata2LTL.txt` directly.

**Examples used and why they fail/pass:**
- `GFa` (1L, 2 states, ι==C) — the minimal Fin-postponement canary. GROUNDED OK.
- `G(a -> X b)` (2L [2,2], safety; states: (1,1) init, (1,2) obligation, (2,1)
  sink) — first 2L target. Diagnosis chain that fixed it: (i) `r_to((1,1)→(2,1))`
  was `false` because no letter from S enters top 2 (entry fires only from
  lower config (2)) → combined-letter enumeration over ALL configs + lower-level
  prefix reach (solid⁺/Formula 5 literal); (ii) the remaining `r_with` failure
  (witness `a&b; !a&b; !a&b; cycle{a&b}`) was in the leave-avoid conjuncts —
  cursor-1 reaches with a REAL bad config exercising the weak cluster for the
  first time (1L never passes B≠None at top) → literal wreach dual + wsolid⁺.
  Now: ALL SUB-TERMS GROUNDED OK.
- Probe script for that diagnosis: `kr/testing/probe_2l_rwith.py` (drills into
  solid⁺ last-step disjuncts and checks each conjunct against the witness word).

**P0-perf step 1 DONE (2026-06-11, this session):** operators + fin_c +
assembly are `spot.formula` objects end-to-end (str accepted at entry for
probes); one shared `spot.tl_simplifier` with persistent cache, at most one
simplify per operator return; `_str_f` no longer simplifies; fin_c computed
once per config in assembly; sentinel guard removed. Validated: GFa +
G(a->Xb) ALL GROUNDED OK, audit CLEAN (patterns 1+5 updated to new shapes),
probe witness passes, survey: `a U b`, `Fa|Gb`, `Fa&Gb`, `Ga|Fb` flip True.
Measured (measure_formula_dag.py): G(a->Xb) builds in 0.08s, 781 DAG nodes,
3.2MB only as flat string (1600x unfolding). A dedicated reach_weak memo
looks unnecessary now (its inner reach_strong is lru-cached; ¬+simplify is
amortized by the persistent simplifier) — revisit only if profiling says so.

**Exact next steps (P0-verify — equiv checking, then semantics):**
1. `G(a->Xb)` (and anything ≥ its size) cannot be equiv-checked by translation:
   126 distinct temporal subformulas → Spot hard error "Too many acceptance
   sets used. The limit is 32" (fast fail, not a stall). Reduce DISTINCT
   temporal subterms: prune vacuous conjuncts (Enter(b)=∅, unreachable pre),
   per-subformula equivalence-based interning (canonicalize language-equal
   subterms to one representative); and/or check compositionally (trace_fin
   grounding is already the per-sub-term oracle) or by word sampling
   (u·v^ω, construction-ref pitfall #10).
2. New minimal failing case from survey: **`Ga | Gb` equiv=FALSE** (safety,
   sizes=[1,4], trivial size-1 top level — suspect the level-collapse /
   trivial-level handling). Diagnose with ltl_diff (containment + witness)
   then trace_fin grounding.
3. `F(a & X b)`: TIMEOUT >45s — find out whether construction or translate;
   if translate, same as item 1.
4. Then: `G(p -> (q U r))` (user request), then 3L (`Xa`).

## P1 — coverage

- Full acceptance dispatch per construction-ref §9.3 (looping-Büchi/coBüchi direct
  Σ₁/Π₁ forms, Büchi/coBüchi Π₂/Σ₂ forms, weak Δ₁ end_in(G)) instead of always going
  through the Muller DNF; keeps outputs in the matching hierarchy class.
- Muller lift exactness for n>2 levels (h⁻¹ powerset lift with SCC pruning + dedup).
- Trivial (size-1) level collapse to reduce effective depth.
- Remove/make-dynamic the >3L dev guard once multi-level is correct.

## P2 — feasibility

- Simplify at every construction step (inside R*/Fin builders), not only post-hoc.
- Systematic early-outs (Enter(t)=∅ ⇒ dashed false; Stay(s)=∅ ⇒ solid τ/false).
- Larger |AP| (on-demand letters or BDD guards instead of explicit 2^k).
- Hierarchy class tagging of outputs (Σᵢ/Πᵢ/Δᵢ per Lemma 5).

## P3 — testing & docs

- Extend semantic grounding from fin_c sub-terms to arbitrary reach calls
  (GT automaton for "reach T from S avoiding B" with β/τ obligations — needed for
  the 2L ladder work above).
- Word-sampling validator (ultimately-periodic u·v^ω: automaton acceptance ⇔ formula,
  per construction-ref pitfall #10).
- More multi-level round-trips + size/depth metrics vs paper bounds.
- Finite-word variant (weak next in wsolid, construction-ref §10) — stretch.
- Counter-free verification for external HOA inputs (GAP IsAperiodic) — stretch.
