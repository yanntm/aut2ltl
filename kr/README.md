# kr/ — Krohn-Rhodes / Holonomy Cascade Path (experimental)

This sub-tree contains the first steps toward an algebraic Büchi (HOA) → LTL translation using Krohn-Rhodes holonomy decomposition (via the SgpDec GAP package), following the approach in:

Udi Boker, Karoliina Lehtinen, Salomon Sickert.  
"On the Translation of Automata to Linear Temporal Logic". FoSSaCS 2022.

See the top-level README for overall project context. This is separate from the heuristic reconstruction in `buchi2ltl/`.

## Current Status (PoC + 1-level clean reconstruction)

We have a working automated pipeline:

Spot automaton  
→ normalize via Spot to deterministic complete minimized parity (min even)  
→ extract concrete generators (one per 2^|AP| letter, from the normalized complete det parity aut)  
→ generate self-contained GAP script using SgpDec (robust for 1-state auts)  
→ run via `gap`  
→ parse into `Cascade` (num_levels, per-level sizes + kinds, state → configuration mapping)

**Decomposition + Configuration Automaton (Phase A)**: Fully general. `Cascade` carries letter valuations (for LTL guards), `move_config()`, `build_config_transitions()`, `build_configuration_automaton()`, and `accepting_configs()`. The configuration automaton is the foundation for reachability. Input auts normalized to det parity min complete (paper contract).

**Reachability + Clean Reconstruction (Phase B extended)**: 
- Generalized inductive 5 reachability formulas (paper Table 1 / Sec 4.2) in `reachability_operators.py`: `reach_strong`/`reach_weak` (Formulas 1/2), solid stay (3/4 with 4 cases + >0), dashed change (5). Base level 0 plain U; recursion on config len via new Cascade sub/Stay/Leave/Enter utils (compute_*_from using move_config). 1-level delegates to old optimized when top-level 1-casc for compat. `simplify_ltl` integrated. Early simplify + full (S,B,beta,T,tau,level) memo as unique table + counters/guards.
- `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi` + `build_infinitely_often_accepting` now attempt multi (up to 3 levels guard) using the generalized reach. Safety short G(stay_g) for init-acc 1-level cases (Ga family).
- **TRACE support**: `KR_TRACE=1` (or set TRACE_ON) for detailed dev traces of the inductive construction (very helpful for cases like "a").
- Still "inf often" framing (not full Fin/acc/Muller assembly); formulas on multi often partial/degen until polish. "a" now fully recovered with EQUIV True (2L; see STATUS.md for log-head diagnosis of nesting + the direct-landing-enter special case in dashed + memo that stabilized). All core CASES now stable (finite LTL, bounded reach calls, no growth logs) via kr/testing direct+subproc. Heuristic kept for comparison.
- Tested via `kr/testing/` (1-level equiv good; multi exercises new path; test_kr_basic.py for simple normal-path I/O + cmdline formulas; timeout-style 5s one-by-one for stability).

**Multi-level / Full General**: Inductive K (5 formulas + recursion + partitions) landed and exercised on 2-level; 3+ limited for stability. Full Fin(C) (Lemma 7), acceptance lift/assembly, and class preservation remain (see kr/algorithm.md + STATUS.md). Clean path usable on some multi but output not yet always correct/equiv.

We follow a "smaller files, one service per module" discipline (see `reachability_operators.py`, `bdd_utils.py` for stability, `gap/parse.py`, `kr/testing/` for verification harnesses).

See `kr/STATUS.md` for detailed roadmap/gaps and `kr/testing/README.md` + test scripts for verification.

Later work will complete the inductive multi-level case + acceptance encoding + top-level formula (per the Boker et al. roadmap).

## Dependencies (what must be on PATH / loadable)

- `gap` (the GAP computer algebra system executable) must be found on your `$PATH`.
  - On Fedora: `sudo dnf install gap gap-core gap-pkg-semigroups` (and friends) is usually sufficient for the base.
  - Other distros: equivalent `gap` / `gap-core` packages.

- The **SgpDec** package must be loadable inside GAP (`LoadPackage("SgpDec")` succeeds).

The easiest way to satisfy the second requirement is to run once:

    ./kr/install.sh

It will download (or git-clone) the current SgpDec release and place it under `~/.gap/pkg/sgpdec` (user-local, no root required for that step). It also does a basic verification.

We are still in PoC stage; there is no fancy multi-platform / container / CI setup yet.

## Usage

```python
from kr import decompose_aut, reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi, reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi_heuristic
import spot

aut = spot.formula("Fa").translate()  # decompose_aut normalizes to det parity min complete internally
casc = decompose_aut(aut)
print(casc)                    # summary
print(casc.state_to_config)    # mapping for LTL synthesis
print(casc.levels)             # sizes + kinds

# Clean thin path (preferred for 1-level; uses K operators only)
print(reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi(casc))

# Old ad-hoc version (for comparison)
print(reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi_heuristic(casc))
```

You can also inspect the exact GAP script:

```python
from kr.gap_bridge import generate_gap_script
from kr.extract import extract_generators

gens, masks, valuations = extract_generators(aut)
script = generate_gap_script(gens)
print(script)
```

Parsing of GAP output is now in the focused `kr/gap/parse.py` service (re-exported from `gap_bridge` for compatibility).

Example generated scripts live in `kr/examples/generated/`.

## Simple Examples (Xa, Fa, GFa, ...)

See `kr/examples/spot_det.py`, `kr/examples/synthetic.py`, `kr/testing/test_kr_reconstruct.py`, and the generated/ .gap files.

Note: The KR path now normalizes to a deterministic complete minimized parity automaton (min even) via Spot before decomposition (per paper). Spot only adds states (e.g. sinks) when needed for completeness; sinks are treated as ordinary states. 1-state auts are handled robustly (GAP script avoids SgpDec holonomy call that would crash). This enables det parity for formulas like FGa that have no small det Buchi.

Typical current behavior (after `./kr/install.sh`):
- Parity min-even det complete norm: formulas like FGa now yield small (1-state) det parity auts and decomp to 1L cascades (no more det-Buchi failures).
- 1L cases like Fa/Ga produce simple equiv via clean K path.
- Constants true/false handled (special acc="t"/"f").
- "a" currently degen under parity aut acc marks (see STATUS); was recovered under prior Buchi norm.
- Multi-level still limited (guard at 3L); clean attempts 2L via generalized reach.

The generated GAP scripts are fully self-contained. They are deterministic given the input generators.

See `kr/testing/` (and its README) for the verification harnesses we use to compare clean vs heuristic and confirm stability (subprocess isolation + repeated decomp on historically problematic cases like Xa).

## Files of interest

- `install.sh` — convenience setup for GAP + SgpDec.
- `gap_bridge.py` — orchestration, script generation, and execution. (Parser extracted to the focused service below for smaller files.)
- `gap/parse.py` + `gap/__init__.py` — focused parser service (structured GAP output → `Cascade`). Re-exported from `gap_bridge` for compatibility.
- `extract.py` — Spot aut → generators (assumes the aut has been normalized to complete deterministic minimized parity by the caller/decompose_aut).
- `cascade.py` — `Cascade` dataclass + config automaton helpers (`build_configuration_automaton`, `move_config`, etc.).
- `reachability_operators.py` — 1-level K operators (`one_level_reach_strong`, `build_1level_reachability`, guard helpers, etc.) + 1-level projection helpers. The core "intelligence".
- `reachability.py` — thin high-level layer: `reconstruct_ltl_1level_buchi` (clean pure builder using the operators) + `_heuristic` (old ad-hoc for comparison) + `build_infinitely_often_accepting`.
- `bdd_utils.py` — stability helpers (precomputed buddy var maps to avoid sporadic segfaults during extraction).
- `examples/` + `testing/` — demos and verification harnesses (see `kr/testing/README.md` and `test_kr_reconstruct.py` / `diag_stability.py`).
- `examples/generated/*.gap` — inspectable generated scripts.

This remains experimental/PoC. Frontend now feeds deterministic minimized parity complete auts (paper contract; 1s robustness added). Next major: inductive multi K + Fin/Inf/acceptance encoding adapted to parity conditions (priorities) on top of clean foundation. See `kr/STATUS.md`.
