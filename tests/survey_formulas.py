tests/survey_formulas.py — the curated survey corpus, in isolation.

This is the ONE place the survey formulas live. They used to be nested inline in
each survey script (`survey_mp_cascade.py`, `survey_sizes.py`); pulling them out
lets `tests/survey.py` (and any future HOA-input survey) share a single,
documented corpus, and lets the corpus be reviewed/extended without touching the
runner.

Each entry is a `SurveyCase(formula, klass, note)`:
  * `formula` — an LTL string in Spot syntax (mind the spaces: "q U r" is the
    until of q and r; "qUr" is a single atomic proposition).
  * `klass`   — the Manna-Pnueli class we expect (B bottom, S safety,
    G guarantee, O obligation, R recurrence, P persistence, T reactivity);
    a label for grouping, NOT asserted — the survey also reads spot.mp_class.
  * `note`    — WHY this formula is in the corpus (what it exercises / why it was
    historically interesting).

The corpus spans the MP hierarchy weakest-first and folds in the cases that were
hard during construction (the former equiv residuals recorded in
aut2ltl/kr/STATUS.md), so a regression on any of them shows up immediately.
