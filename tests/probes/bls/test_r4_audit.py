tests/probes/bls/test_r4_audit.py

Placed audit script (per rules) for P0 R4/Rws correctness items.
The 5-point checklist below is the authoritative encoding of the R4/Rws0 + R5
structural corrections (verified against paper/Automata2LTL.txt pp. 11-13).

Focus: semantic grounding (Path A), duality hints (Path B), exact 5-point
checklist (Path C) against current _*_weak / Rws usage, plus better canary
(Path D) like G(p | F q) style.

Does NOT modify core formula code. Only inspects + exercises current impl
behaviorally + via source for the checklist. Uses Spot for semantics checks
on crafted words/configs for 1L reset cascades.

Run (always):
  python3 -m tests.probes.bls.test_r4_audit

All inside work folder, no /tmp, no inline long python.
