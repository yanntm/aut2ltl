# Benchmark samples — Kinská

Benchmark Büchi automata (HOA format) and their source LTL formulae, adopted as
test inputs for our automata→LTL construction.

## Layout

Mirrors the upstream `experiments_data/` directory:

- `counting/{1ap,2ap}/` — counting Büchi automata.
- `randltl/{1,2,4,8}ap-ba/` — random-LTL Büchi automata, with the source formula
  lists in the sibling `*-formulae/` directories.

## Our results on this corpus (2026-06-15, preliminary)

Full detail (per-input formula, sizes, verdict) is in
**`logs/reference/kinska.csv`** + `SUMMARY.txt`.


A like-for-like comparison (our aperiodicity gate vs their decider, per instance,
and whether our 8 validated cases fall in their confirmed-51 or timed-out-34) is
left for a dedicated follow-up.
